Each of these space will be a different way of \"seeing this data\" and if we adopt the language from Scott Page [-@pageWhyManyModelThinkers2018], they will have different \"attentions\". \n\nWhat the following exercise will do is to walk you through the variables of this data set through a few visualisations. It will then create a few different projections and will give them some names. What we expect you to do is to create your own projections and try to interpret them. \n\nIf you want to be reminded of what MDS is, you can have a look at the slides from last week. In a super tiny nutshell, MDS tries to create a space where \"real\" distances in the data are preserved as much as possible while \"projecting\" the data elements on a lower dimensional space. For instance, the following is from the slide deck:\n\n![An MDS plot of cities.](figs/mds.png){width=800}\n\nWhat we see here are a few cities that would normally \"exist\" in our 3-dimensional world and the distances between them would normally be on this spherical coordinate system. But we create here is a 2D map and the distances between cities are preserved as much as possible. Near cities in the world are closer, and the further ones are further but not as accurate as it is in the world. The dimensions here carry no real meaning it is the distances that will \"tell a story\" (if there is one).\n\nOK, let's get on with the data now.\n\n## Data exploration and wrangling\n\n::: {.cell

Our job now is to relate these two projections to one another. Do you see similarities? Do you see clusters of boroughs? Can you reflect on how you can relate and combine these two maps conceptually?\n\n**Second task:**\n\nCan you think of and then generate other maps that you can produce with this data? Have a look at the variables once again and try to produce new \"perspectives\" to the data and see what they have to say. \n\nAlso think of visualisations to help you here, can you colour them with a different variable? What would that change?\n\n:::\n\n",
