With data and data related artefacts becoming ubiquitous in all aspects of social life, data science gains access to new sources of data, is taken up across an expanding range of research fields and disciplines, and increasingly engages with societal challenges. The module provides an advanced introduction to the theoretical and scientific frameworks of data science, and to the fundamental techniques for working with data using appropriate procedures, algorithms and visualisation.\nStudents learn how to critically approach data and data-driven artefacts, and engage with and critically reflect on contemporary discussions around the practice of data science, its compatibility with different analytics frameworks and disciplinary, and its relation to on-going digital transformations of society. As well as lectures discussing the theoretical, scientific and ethical frameworks of data science, the module features coding labs and workshops that expose students to the practice of working effectively with data, algorithms, and analytical techniques, as well as providing a platform for reflective and critical discussions on data science practices, resulting data artefacts and how they can be interpreted, actioned and influence society."

    "text": "Course contents\n\nIntroduction and historical perspectives (Chapter 1)\nThis week discusses data science as a field that cuts across disciplines and provides a historical perspective on the subject. We discuss the terms Data Science and Data Scientists, reflect on examples of Data Science projects, and discuss the research process at a methodological level.\n\n\nThinking Data: Theoretical and Practical Concerns (Chapter 5)\nThis week explores the cultural, ethical, and critical challenges posed by data artefacts and data-intensive scientific processes. Engaging with Critical Data Studies, we discuss issues around data capture, curation, data quality, inclusion/exclusion and representativeness. The session also discusses the different kinds of data that one can encounter across disciplines, the underlying characteristics of data and how we can analytically and practically approach data quality issues and the challenge of identifying and curating appropriate data sets.\n\n\nAbstractions and Models (Chapter 10)\nThis week discusses ways of abstracting data. We start by visiting statistics as a means of representing data and its inherent characteristics. The session moves on to discuss the notion of a “model” and visit the different schools of thought within model-ing, as well as a tour of fundamental statistical models that help abstract data and its inherent relations.\n\n\nStructures and Spaces (Chapter 14)\nThis week explores the notion of structures and how data science can enable the extraction of “hidden” underlying groups – clusters – and hierarchical structures from data. We discuss the different techniques to surface and generate artificial boundaries and how the resulting artefacts can be interpreted. This session then investigates how artificial and abstract spaces can be constructed through different “projection” techniques, and how these spaces help us navigate data that are high-dimensional in nature and apply analytic frameworks to them.\n\n\nMulti-model Thinking and Rigour in Data Science (Chapter 19)\nThis week we focus on multi-model approaches as a way of thinking and how critical, pluralistic thinking can improve our understanding of the underlying phenomena implicit in data. We also discuss how to adopt a comprehensive approach to the data science process, and investigate indicators of rigour in data science.\n\n\nRecognising and Avoiding Traps (Chapter 25)\nData analysis and statistical routines and procedures are ingrained with several pitfalls and limitations – these range from methodological pitfalls in the processes and data that once can use, to cognitive and behavioural pitfalls that one can come across in making inferences from data and data artefacts. This week we discuss such theoretical and practical traps and pitfalls, how we can be aware of them and what approaches we have to avoid them.\n\n\nData Science and Society (Chapter 31)\nWe will engage with academic and practices discourse on the social, cultural and ethical aspects of data science, and discuss around how one can responsibly carry out data science research on social phenomena, whether data science can be a transformative power in society, and what ethical and social frameworks can help us to critically approach data science practices and its effects on society, and what are ethical practices for data scientists.\n\n\nData Science Workshop 1: Design Thinking in Data Science (Chapter 36)\nThis week explores the question “Can we approach data science as a design problem?” and discusses how one can embrace a user-centred approach to design appropriate data science processes. We will do this through hands-on practical where we go through the data science process over an applied case.\n\n\nData Science Workshop 2: Bring Your Own Data (Chapter 38)\nThis workshop week will involve you working hands-on towards your final assessments individually but in small coding groups. In the workshop session, we would like to hear from you on your ideas for your second coursework. You will also be able to use this session to start working on the dataset(s) that you have decided (or still considering) to analyse as part of your second assessment and discuss with your peers and with the staff members."

    "text": "What does this module aim to achieve?\nIn this module, students gain both formal knowledge and practical experience of the theoretical, scientific and ethical frameworks underpinning data science and critically reflect on the scope and impact of these frameworks. Lectures will provide a grounded understanding of the theoretical and scientific frameworks underpinning data science. In workshops, students gain experience of the fundamentals of the practice of data science, and through seminars they will be exposed to academic debates in data studies and related fields about the changing role of data science in society as seen in, for instance, the increasing use of data artefacts in policy and decision making in governmental bodies and businesses, how scientific discoveries are made and communicated, or how (in)equalities and power (im)balances are surfacing in uses of data. The module aims to build the required skills to apply data science techniques and algorithms within and across analytics frameworks developed in different disciplines. The module aims to cultivate a holistic data science practice which reviews the whole data science process critically and inquisitively, and handles problems through a user-centred thinking. This practice also embraces critical reflection about the data, algorithms, and data artefacts, as well as the ethical, societal, and cultural implications of data science broadly conceived."

This means that the in-person classes will be mostly used for discussions, Q&As, hands-on activities and for “doing” data science. There will be less time dedicated to traditional lectures during the in-person sessions. Instead, pre-recorded lecture videos will be provided as learning material.\nLecture materials such as slides and reading lists, and pre-recorded lecture videos that introduce the week’s content will be made available each week. You are expected to go through these material before the in-person sessions. We will use the Q&A sessions to go over any open questions and to reflect collectively on the week’s material. In most weeks, we will start with a brief recap of what is discussed in the pre-recorded lecture materials."

The short report will expect students to engage with the related literature and reflect on the decisions made by the researchers of the project. Within the second component, the data-driven essay, students will report on a data science project that they carried on a chosen question and appropriate data set. The essay will be reporting on the data science process from initiation to evaluation to reflection while engaging with the relevant literature in the domain.

    "section": "2.1 Technological stack",
    "text": "2.1 Technological stack\nThis module uses a combination of different technologies (technological stack) besides python. You will need to be familiar with all their components to follow the labs as well as the assignments. You can find a brief description of the main components below, and you can refer to Appendix A for a more technical explanation of the setup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nPlease make sure you have Anaconda Python installed and running on your computer. Instructions for doing this can be found on Appendix A.\n\n\n\n2.1.1 Python\nPython is a very popular general purpose programming language. Data scientists use it to clean up, analyse and visualise data. A major strength of python is that the core Python functionality can be extended using libraries. In future labs, you will learn about popular data science libraries such as pandas and numpy.\nIt is useful to think of programming languages as a structured way to tell the computer what to do. We cover some of the basic features of Python in this lab.\n\n\n2.1.2 Anaconda\nAnaconda1 is a distribution platform that manages and installs many tools used in data science, such as programming languages (python), libraries, IDEs2… as well as a GUI (Anaconda navigator) and a CLI (Anaconda interpreter). Anaconda does some other useful things, such as creating isolated virtual environments, which we will be using for this module.1 If you want to know more about Anaconda, these tutorials can be a good start: https://www.tangolearn.com/what-is-anaconda/, https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-anaconda-tutorial/2 Some specific Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) for Python included in Anaconda are VS Code, Jupyterlab and Spyder. In this module, there’s no preferred IDE (actually, different members of the staff use different IDEs) and you can use the one you are more familiar with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVirtual environments\n\n\n\nVirtual environments are a way to install all the dependencies (and their right version) required for a certain project by isolating python and libraries’ specific versions. Every person who recreatesthe virtual environment will be using the same packages and versions, reducing errors and increasing reproducibility. While they are considered an advanced practice, and are therefore out of scope of this course, you may want to learn about Python’s environments here: https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/\n\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Jupter Notebooks\nJupyter notebooks, such as this one, allow you to combine text and code into documents you can edit in the browser. The power of these notebooks is in documenting or describing what you are doing with the code alongside that code. For example, you could detail why you chose a particular clustering algorithm above the clustering code itself. In other words, it add narrative and helps clarify your workflow.\n\n\n\nThis same notebook, as displayed within Jupyterlab"

    "section": "2.3 Data Types",
    "text": "2.3 Data Types\nAs we saw at this unit in the Skills Programme, programming languages use types to help them understand what a piece of data might represent. Knowing how data types work is important because they define what can be done and cannot be done with them. Each programming language has different data types which can be extended by other libraries such as Pandas, but these are some of the most frequent ones (and the ones we will be facing more frequently).\n\n2.3.1 int, floats, strings\nIntegers are whole numbers, like the ones we used above. We can check an object’s data type using type():\n\ntype(33)\n\nint\n\n\nYou can also have floats (numbers with decimal points)\n\n33.4\n\n33.4\n\n\n\ntype(33.4)\n\nfloat\n\n\nand a series of characters (strings).\n\n'I have a plan, sir.'\n\n'I have a plan, sir.'\n\n\n\ntype('I have a plan, sir.')\n\nstr\n\n\nData types are great and operators such as * do different things depending on the data type. For instance,\n\n33 * 3\n\n99\n\n\nThat seems quite sensible. What about if we had a string? Run teh below line. What is the * doing?\n\n'I have a plan, sir' * 3\n\n'I have a plan, sirI have a plan, sirI have a plan, sir'\n\n\nThere are also operators which only work with particular data types.\n\n'I have a plan, sir.' / 2\n\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'int'\n\n\nThis error message is very informative indeed. It tells us the line which caused the problem and that we have an error. Specifically, our error is a TypeError.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the error\n\n\n\nIn this case, it says that the line 'I have a cunning plan' / 2 consists of string / int. We are trying to divide a string and int. The / operand is not able to divide a string by an int.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 lists and dictionaries\nYou can collect multiple values in a list. This is how they look like:\n\n[35, 'brown', 'yes']\n\n[35, 'brown', 'yes']\n\n\nAnd we can check theyr type:\n\ntype([35, 'brown', 'yes'])\n\nlist\n\n\nOr add keys to the values as a dictionary.\n\n{'age':35, 'hair colour': 'brown', 'Glasses': 'yes'}\n\n{'age': 35, 'hair colour': 'brown', 'Glasses': 'yes'}\n\n\n\ntype({'age':35, 'hair colour': 'brown', 'Glasses': 'yes'})\n\ndict"

If you pass the variable name to the interpreter then it will behave just like if you typed in 140 instead.\n\nmy_height\n\n140\n\n\n140\nVariables are neat when it comes to lists.\n\nmy_heights = [231, 234, 43]\nmy_heights\n\n[231, 234, 43]\n\n\n\nmy_heights[1]\n\n234\n\n\nWait, what happened above?

For instance, can we get a length of an int?\n\nlen(4)\n\nTypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()\n\n\nThe error “TypeError: object of type ‘int’ has no len()” essentially means an int object has no len dunder method.\nTo see the methods for a given object, type in the object name in a code cell, add a period ‘.’ and press tab."

The for statement finishes with a : and the next line has a tab. For loops have to be defined like that. If you miss out the tab then you will be shown an error. It does make the code more readable though.\n\nfor ingredient in lunch_ingredients:\n    print(ingredient)\n\ngravy\npotatoes\nmeat\nveg\nyorkshire pudding\n\n\nAt least the error is informative.\nWe can have more than one line in the loop.\n\nfor ingredient in lunch_ingredients:\n    print('I love to eat ' + ingredient)\n    print('food is great')\n    \n\nI love to eat gravy\nfood is great\nI love to eat potatoes\nfood is great\nI love to eat meat\nfood is great\nI love to eat veg\nfood is great\nI love to eat yorkshire pudding\nfood is great\n\n\n\n\n3.3.2 If statements\nAn if statement allows us to run different code depending on a condition.\n\nmy_num = 3\n\nif my_num &gt; 5:\n    print('Number is bigger than 5')\n    \nif my_num &lt; 5:\n    print('Number is less than 5')\n\nNumber is less than 5\n\n\nWe can include this in a for loop.\n\nfor i in range(10): #go through each number 0:10\n    print(i)\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n    if i == 5:\n        print('We found a 5!')\n\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nWe found a 5!\n6\n7\n8\n9\n\n\nYou can also include an else part of your if statement.\n\nfor i in range(10):\n    print(i)\n    if i == 5:\n        print('We found a 5! :)')\n    else:\n        print('Not a 5.

There is.\n\n\n4.1.2 Pandas\nThe Pandas library is designed with data science in mind. You will examine it more in the coming weeks. Reading CSV files with pandas is very easy.\n\nimport pandas as pd\n\nThe import x as y is good practice. In the below code, anything with a pd. prefix comes from pandas. This is particulary useful for preventing a module from overwriting inbuilt Python functionality.\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('data/Facebook.csv', encoding = 'UTF-8')\n\nThat was easy.

Engaging with Critical Data Studies, we discuss issues around data capture, curation, data quality, inclusion/exclusion and representativeness. The session also discusses the different kinds of data that one can encounter across disciplines, the underlying characteristics of data and how we can analytically and practically approach data quality issues and the challenge of identifying and curating appropriate data sets.\nSome of the key concepts you should remember from this week are …\n\nThinking broadly on and with data – ethical considerations, potential biases\nData type taxonomies, w.r.t., sources of data, scales of measurement and common interpretations of data: tabular, temporal, spatial, textual, network\nData wrangling: concepts and common methods, missing values and data transformation approaches"

For instance, for read_csv(), this page is much more useful – https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html\nWe recommend that you use a search engine very frequently.\n\n?pd.read_csv\n\nThe Pandas documentation is rather good. Relevent to our below work is:\n\nWhat kind of data does pandas handle?\nHow to calculate summary statistics?\nHow to create plots in pandas?\nHow to handle time series data with ease?\n\nI also found a rather nice series of lessons a kind person put together. There are lots of online tutorials which will help you."

    "text": "6.4 Structure\nIn Section 2.3 we introduced Python’s data types as well as how to use the function type() to retrieve an object’s data type. Pandas expands python’s data types by creating a new one called data frame\n\n\nDo you remember what are Python’s data types? You can refer to Section 2.3 for a refresher and to know more about them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData frames\n\n\n\nData frames are 2-dimensional data structures that store information in columns and rows, very much like data is stored in a spreadsheet or a database. Typically, every column will contain variables (or sometimes called attributes) whereas every row represents an observation. This is known as wide data frames, as opposed to long data frames.\nIn pandas, every column has a name and rows can be named, too.\n\n\nSo let’s check the what our newly created object’s (df) data type:\n\ntype(df)\n\npandas.core.frame.DataFrame\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, df is a `DataFrame`` object, provided by pandas.\nThe DataFrame object has lots of built in methods and attributes.\nThe info method gives us information about datatypes, dimensions and the presence of null values in our dataframe. Let’s see how can we use it and what information is returned:\n\ndf.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 188 entries, 0 to 187\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column       Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------       --------------  -----  \n 0   season       188 non-null    int64  \n 1   episode      188 non-null    int64  \n 2   title        188 non-null    object \n 3   imdb_rating  188 non-null    float64\n 4   total_votes  188 non-null    int64  \n 5   air_date     188 non-null    object \ndtypes: float64(1), int64(3), object(2)\nmemory usage: 8.9+ KB\n\n\nWe can just dtypes to check the data types of every variable in the data frame.\n\ndf.dtypes\n\nseason           int64\nepisode          int64\ntitle           object\nimdb_rating    float64\ntotal_votes      int64\nair_date        object\ndtype: object\n\n\nOr just the dimensions (e.g., rows and columns).\n\ndf.shape\n\n(188, 6)\n\n\nIn this case, there are only 188 rows. But for larger datasets we might want to look at the head (top 5) and tail (bottom 5) rows using .head() and .tail(), respectively.\n\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseason\nepisode\ntitle\nimdb_rating\ntotal_votes\nair_date\n\n\n\n\n0\n1\n1\nPilot\n7.6\n3706\n2005-03-24\n\n\n1\n1\n2\nDiversity Day\n8.3\n3566\n2005-03-29\n\n\n2\n1\n3\nHealth Care\n7.9\n2983\n2005-04-05\n\n\n3\n1\n4\nThe Alliance\n8.1\n2886\n2005-04-12\n\n\n4\n1\n5\nBasketball\n8.4\n3179\n2005-04-19\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf.tail()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nseason\nepisode\ntitle\nimdb_rating\ntotal_votes\nair_date\n\n\n\n\n183\n9\n19\nStairmageddon\n8.0\n1484\n2013-04-11\n\n\n184\n9\n20\nPaper Airplane\n8.0\n1482\n2013-04-25\n\n\n185\n9\n21\nLivin' the Dream\n8.9\n2041\n2013-05-02\n\n\n186\n9\n22\nA.A.R.M.\n9.3\n2860\n2013-05-09\n\n\n187\n9\n23\nFinale\n9.7\n7934\n2013-05-16"

    "text": "6.6 Subsetting\nOften times we may have a large dataset and we only need to work with just a part of it (a subset) consisting of certain columns and/or rows. Selecting specific columns and/or rows is known as subsetting.\n\n6.6.1 Selecting columns\nBecause in pandas every column has a name, we can select columns by their name or their position.\n\n6.6.1.1 Selecting by name\nTo select by name we will use the syntax df['&lt;column_name&gt;']. For example, if we wanted to select the ratings:\n\ndf['imdb_rating']\n\n0      7.6\n1      8.3\n2      7.9\n3      8.1\n4      8.4\n      ... \n183    8.0\n184    8.0\n185    8.9\n186    9.3\n187    9.7\nName: imdb_rating, Length: 188, dtype: float64\n\n\nor we could select the date in which the chapters were first aired:\n\ndf['air_date']\n\n0      2005-03-24\n1      2005-03-29\n2      2005-04-05\n3      2005-04-12\n4      2005-04-19\n          ...    \n183    2013-04-11\n184    2013-04-25\n185    2013-05-02\n186    2013-05-09\n187    2013-05-16\nName: air_date, Length: 188, dtype: object\n\n\nWe can even select more than one column!\n\ndf[['imdb_rating', 'total_votes']]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimdb_rating\ntotal_votes\n\n\n\n\n0\n7.6\n3706\n\n\n1\n8.3\n3566\n\n\n2\n7.9\n2983\n\n\n3\n8.1\n2886\n\n\n4\n8.4\n3179\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n183\n8.0\n1484\n\n\n184\n8.0\n1482\n\n\n185\n8.9\n2041\n\n\n186\n9.3\n2860\n\n\n187\n9.7\n7934\n\n\n\n\n188 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nDid you notice that we used two sets of squared brackets ([[]])? This is needed because we need to passing a list of the column names to the __getitem__ method of the pandas dataframe object, and as you may remember from Section 2.3.2, this is the syntax used for lists (thank this stackoverflow question).\nThis is what we’d get otherwise:\n\ndf['imdb_rating', 'total_votes']\n\nKeyError: ('imdb_rating', 'total_votes')\n\n\nYou can also check out the pandas documentation on indexing and selecting data.\n\n\nWe can also apply methods to subset, such as this one to get the average rating:\n\ndf['imdb_rating'].mean()\n\n8.25744680851064\n\n\nOr to calculate the total number of votes:\n\ndf['total_votes'].sum()\n\n399810\n\n\nOr a combination of multiple columns:\n\ndf[['imdb_rating', 'total_votes']].mean()\n\nimdb_rating       8.257447\ntotal_votes    2126.648936\ndtype: float64\n\n\n\n\n6.6.1.2 Selecting by position\nIf we do not want to use column names, we can use iloc method by using the syntax &lt;object&gt;.iloc[&lt;row slice&gt;, &lt;column slice&gt;], where a slice is a range of numbers separated by a colon :. So, if we were to select the value in the 4th row and 2nd column, we’d use:\n\ndf.iloc[4,2]\n\n'Basketball'\n\n\nBut if we just wanted to select a column?

Usually this is done by using a shared column between the two datasets that works as an index. Gladly, head() reveals that in both cases there is a common column called id. We can join the two dataframes together using the common column.\n\ninner_join_office_df = pd.merge(df_1, df_2, on='id', how='inner')\ninner_join_office_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\nseason\nepisode\nimdb_rating\ntotal_votes\n\n\n\n\n0\n5-1\n5\n1\n8.8\n2501\n\n\n1\n9-13\n9\n13\n7.7\n1394\n\n\n2\n5-6\n5\n6\n8.5\n2018\n\n\n3\n3-23\n3\n23\n9.3\n3010\n\n\n4\n9-16\n9\n16\n8.2\n1572\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n183\n5-21\n5\n21\n8.7\n2032\n\n\n184\n2-13\n2\n13\n8.3\n2363\n\n\n185\n9-6\n9\n6\n7.8\n1455\n\n\n186\n2-2\n2\n2\n8.2\n2736\n\n\n187\n3-4\n3\n4\n8.0\n2311\n\n\n\n\n188 rows × 5 columns\n\n\n\nIn this way you can combine datasets using common columns and an inner join.

You’ve reached the end of a pretty long notebook that went through a lot of details about how to work with this pretty critical package called Pandas.

We particuarly recomment the User Guide that will answer most of your questions and will give you a lot of code to copy and paste first and then modify to do what you need to do – https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide"

In other words, we want to know if these two data variables are related.

For python, any missing data will be represented as any of these values: NaN (Not a Number), NA (Not Available) or None. This is to differenciate that with cases where we may see a “gap” in the dataframe that may look like a missing data, but it is an empty string instead (\"\") or a string with a white space (\" \"). These are not considered empty values.\n\n\nRegretfully, exploring the head or the tail of the dataframe may not be a good idea, especially in large datasets. We may want to use info instead:\n\ndf.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 188 entries, 0 to 187\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column       Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------       --------------  -----  \n 0   season       188 non-null    int64  \n 1   episode      188 non-null    int64  \n 2   title        188 non-null    object \n 3   imdb_rating  170 non-null    float64\n 4   total_votes  168 non-null    float64\n 5   air_date     188 non-null    object \ndtypes: float64(2), int64(2), object(2)\nmemory usage: 8.9+ KB\n\n\nWe are missing values in our imdb_rating and total_votes columns. Now, we need to know how many values are missing. We can do that in multiple ways. One is to combine the method .isna , which returns either True (1) or False (2), and then sum the values that are true (and thus, are null):\n\n# Count missing values\ndf.isna().sum()\n\nseason          0\nepisode         0\ntitle           0\nimdb_rating    18\ntotal_votes    20\nair_date        0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nAnother method is to get the maximum possible values and substract the sum of existing values:\n\n# Count missing values\ndf.shape[0] - df.count()\n# df.shape returns the size of the dataframe and count() will only count the rows where there is a value\n\nseason          0\nepisode         0\ntitle           0\nimdb_rating    18\ntotal_votes    20\nair_date        0\ndtype: int64\n\n\nNow we have an understanding of where the issues are and how many are there. Now the question is: What to do with missing data?"

However, transformation are not magic and we cannot turn a heavily positively skewed distribution into a normally distributed one.\nOh well.\nWe can calculate z scores though so we can plot both total_votes and imdb_ratings on a single plot. Currently, the IMDB scores vary between 0 and 10 whereas the number of votes number in the thousands.\n\ndf['total_votes_z'] = (df['total_votes'] - df['total_votes'].mean()) / df['total_votes'].std()\ndf['imdb_rating_z'] = (df['imdb_rating'] - df['imdb_rating'].mean()) / df['imdb_rating'].std()\n\n\ndf['total_votes_z'].hist()\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf['imdb_rating_z'].hist()\n\n&lt;Axes: &gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can compare the trends in score and number of votes on a single plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nWe are going to use a slightly different approach to creating the plots. Called to the plot() method from Pandas actually use a library called matplotlib. We are going to use the pyplot module of matplotlib directly.\n\n\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nConvert the air_date into a datetime object.\n\ndf['air_date'] =  pd.to_datetime(df['air_date'], dayfirst=True)\n\nThen call the subplots function fom pyplot to create two plots. From this we take the two plot axis (ax1, ax2) and call the method scatter for each to plot imdb_rating_z and total_votes_z.\n\nplt.style.use('ggplot')\n\nf, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharey=True)\nax1.scatter( df['air_date'], df['imdb_rating_z'], color = 'red')\nax1.set_title('IMDB rating')\nax2.scatter( df['air_date'], df['total_votes_z'], color = 'blue')\nax2.set_title('Total votes')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Total votes')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can do better than that.\n\nplt.scatter(df['air_date'], df['imdb_rating_z'], color = 'red', alpha = 0.1)\nplt.scatter(df['air_date'], df['total_votes_z'], color = 'blue', alpha = 0.1)\n\n&lt;matplotlib.collections.PathCollection at 0x14e426290&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have done a lot so far. Exploring data in part 1, plotting data with the inbuilt Pandas methods in part 2 and dealing with both missing data and transfromations in part 3.\nIn part 4, we will look at creating your own functions, a plotting library called seaborn and introduce a larger dataset."

Think about visuals that can help you here? Maybe a histrogram would help?\n\nsns.histplot(data=?, x=\"?\")\n\n\n\nOnce you have an idea of the descriptive statistics, you might want to focus on the outliers. It might be difficult to spot outliers just with the descriptive statistics. This is where we can use data visualisations to identify outliers visually and also make use of a few proxy metrics to help us assess data points.\n\n\n11.1.2 Identify outliers visually\nIn this case we will explore variables individually (1D) by creating a boxplot1. We will visualise the columns price and mileage using matplotlib’s subplots, which combines multiple plots into a single figure:1 Boxplots may be difficult to interpret if we are not used to them. It is used to visualise distributions, where the box represents the Interquartile range (IQR), whereas the whiskers can be defined in multiple ways (e.g. the first and third quartiles, 1.5 IQR…) .  From Wikipedia: “In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles.”\n\n# 1D Visualizations\nplt.figure(figsize=(9, 5)) # Setting the figure's size: format width, height (in inches)\nplt.subplot(1,2,1) # subplot(nrows, ncols, index, **kwargs)\nplt.boxplot(df.price)\nplt.title(\"Boxplot of the Price attribute\")\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nplt.boxplot(df.mileage)\nplt.title(\"Boxplot of the Mileage attribute\");\n# A semicolon in Python denotes separation, rather than termination. \n# It allows you to write multiple statements on the same line. \n\n\n\n\nBut we may want to identify the 2D outliers using a scatterplot\n\n# 2D Visualization\nplt.scatter(df.price, df.mileage, alpha = .5)\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Mileage')\nplt.title('Mileage vs. Price\\n');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nVisually, outliers appear to be outside the ‘normal’ range of the rest of the points. A few outliers are quite obvious to spot, but the choice of the threshold (the limit after which you decide to label a point as an outlier) visually remains a very subjective matter.\n\n\n\n\n11.1.3 Computing outliers’ threshold: standard deviation\nAdd two new columns to the dataframe called isOutlierPrice and isOutlierMileage. We will define our threshold as 2 times standard deviations away from the mean for price and mileage, respectively.\n\n# Computing the isOutlierPrice column\nupper_threshold_price = df.price.mean() + 2*df.price.std() \nlower_threshold_price = df.price.mean() - 2*df.price.std()\ndf['isOutlierPrice'] = ((df.price &gt; upper_threshold_price) | (df.price &lt; lower_threshold_price))\n\n# Computing the isOutlierMileage column\nupper_threshold_mileage = df.mileage.mean() + 2*df.mileage.std()\nlower_threshold_mileage = df.mileage.mean() - 2*df.mileage.std()\ndf['isOutlierMileage'] = ((df.mileage &gt; upper_threshold_mileage) | (df.mileage &lt; lower_threshold_mileage))\n\n# Inspect the new DataFrame with the added columns\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nmileage\nyear\ntrim\nengine\ntransmission\nisOutlierPrice\nisOutlierMileage\n\n\n\n\n0\n14995\n67697\n2006\nex\n4 Cyl\nManual\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n1\n11988\n73738\n2006\nex\n4 Cyl\nManual\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n2\n11999\n80313\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n3\n12995\n86096\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n4\n11333\n79607\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative method\n\n\n\nWe may want to use this more succint approach:\n\n# Second way of doing the above using the np.where() function\ndf['isOutlierPrice'] = np.where(abs(df.price - df.price.mean()) &lt; 2*df.price.std(), False, True)\ndf['isOutlierMileage'] = np.where(abs(df.mileage - df.mileage.mean()) &lt; 2*df.mileage.std(), False, True)\n\n# Inspect the new DataFrame with the added columns\ndf.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprice\nmileage\nyear\ntrim\nengine\ntransmission\nisOutlierPrice\nisOutlierMileage\n\n\n\n\n0\n14995\n67697\n2006\nex\n4 Cyl\nManual\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n1\n11988\n73738\n2006\nex\n4 Cyl\nManual\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n2\n11999\n80313\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n3\n12995\n86096\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n4\n11333\n79607\n2006\nlx\n4 Cyl\nAutomatic\nFalse\nFalse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we’d expect, both methods produce the same output.\n\n\nNow that we have these two new columns, we could visualize these values with a different color in the plot. Observe whether they are the same as you would mark them:\n\n# Visualizing outliers in a different color\ncol = ['tomato' if i+j else 'seagreen' for i,j in zip(df.isOutlierPrice, df.isOutlierMileage)]\nplt.scatter(df.price, df.mileage, color = col)\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Mileage')\nplt.title('Mileage vs. Price : Outliers 2+ std\\'s away from the mean\\n');\n\n\n\n\nVisually filtering out outliers can be an effective tactic if we’re just trying to conduct a quick and dirty experimentation. However, when we need to perform a solid and founded analysis, it’s better to have a robust justification for our choices.\nIn this case, we can use the deviation from the mean to define a threshold that separates ‘normal’ values from ‘outliers’. Here, we opted for a two standard deviation threshold.\nThe mathematical intuition behind this, is that under the normality assumption (if we assume our variable is normally distributed, which it almost is, refer to the next plot), then the probability of it having a value two standard deviations OR MORE away from the mean, is around 5%, which is very unlikely to happen. This is why we label these data points as outliers with respect to the (assumed) probability distribution of the variable. But this remains a way to identify 1D outliers only (identifying outliers within each column separately)\n\n# Histograms of Price and Mileage (checking the normality assumption)\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nplt.hist(df.price, bins = 12)\nplt.title('Price')\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nplt.hist(df.mileage, bins = 15)\nplt.title('Mileage');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.1.4 Computing outliers’ threshold: Mahalanobis distance\n\nUsing the 2D Mahalanobis distance to find outliers\n\n\n# Mean vector (computing the mean returns a Series, which we need to convert back to a DataFrame because cdist requires it)\nmean_v = df.iloc[:, 0:2].mean().to_frame().T # DataFrame.T returns the Transpose of the DataFrame\n#mean_v = np.asarray([df.price.mean(), df.mileage.mean() ]).reshape(1,2) # This is a better way of writing the line before (for our use case : cdist function)\n\n# Computing the Mahalanobis distance of each row to the mean vector\nd = cdist(df.iloc[:, 0:2], mean_v, metric='mahalanobis')\n#d = cdist(df[['price', 'mileage']].values, mean_v, metric='mahalanobis') # Another way of writing the line before\n\n# Visualizing the scatter plot while coloring each point (i.e row) with a color from a chosen gradient colormap corresponding to the mahalanobis score\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))\nplt.scatter(df.price, df.mileage, c = d.flatten(), cmap = 'plasma') # in order to know why we use flatten() on d, try printing d with and without flatten\nplt.colorbar() # to show the colorbar\nplt.xlabel('Price')\nplt.ylabel('Mileage')\nplt.title('Mileage vs. Price colored by a 2D Mahalanobis score\\n');"

From the shape of the Q-Q Plot above (convex, slope upwards) and the Slide of Q-Q Plots from Week 3, we could conclude before looking at the histogram that our distribution was right tailed (or positively skewed if you’re into complex vocabulary lol). And it is !"

You can make use of a series of boxplots to exploratively analyse the data for outliers\n\n\n# Listing the columns\ndf_tuber.columns\n\nIndex(['country', 'iso2', 'iso3', 'iso_numeric', 'g_whoregion', 'year',\n       'e_pop_num', 'e_prev_100k', 'e_prev_100k_lo', 'e_prev_100k_hi',\n       'e_prev_num', 'e_prev_num_lo', 'e_prev_num_hi', 'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_100k',\n       'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_100k_lo', 'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_100k_hi',\n       'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_num', 'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_num_lo',\n       'e_mort_exc_tbhiv_num_hi', 'source_mort', 'e_inc_100k', 'e_inc_100k_lo',\n       'e_inc_100k_hi', 'e_inc_num', 'e_inc_num_lo', 'e_inc_num_hi',\n       'e_tbhiv_prct', 'e_tbhiv_prct_lo', 'e_tbhiv_prct_hi',\n       'e_inc_tbhiv_100k', 'e_inc_tbhiv_100k_lo', 'e_inc_tbhiv_100k_hi',\n       'e_inc_tbhiv_num', 'e_inc_tbhiv_num_lo', 'e_inc_tbhiv_num_hi',\n       'source_tbhiv', 'c_cdr', 'c_cdr_lo', 'c_cdr_hi'],\n      dtype='object')\n\n\n\n# Alright I already know a few columns with outliers but let's try to find them together exploratively using BoxPlots\ncolname = 'c_cdr' # change the column name by choosing different ones from above (numeric ones)\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,5))\nplt.subplot(1,2,1)\nplt.hist(df_tuber[colname])\nplt.title('Histogram of \"{}\"'.format(colname))\nplt.subplot(1,2,2)\nplt.boxplot(df_tuber[colname]);\nplt.title('Boxplot of \"{}\"'.format(colname));\n\n\n\n\n\n# Chosen columns : I picked 3, feel free to change them and experiment\nchosen_colnames = ['e_pop_num', 'e_prev_100k', 'c_cdr']\n\n2) For the chosen columns, estimate both the conventional and the robust descriptive statistics and compare. Observe how these pairs deviate from each other based on the characteristics of the underlying data\n\n# Central Tendency : Mean vs Median (Median is the robust version of the mean, because it takes into account \n#the ordering of the points and not the actual values like the mean does)\ndf_tuber[chosen_colnames].describe().loc[['mean', '50%'], :] # The 50% is the median (50% quantile)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne_pop_num\ne_prev_100k\nc_cdr\n\n\n\n\nmean\n2.899179e+07\n207.694422\n67.570706\n\n\n50%\n5.140332e+06\n93.000000\n70.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at how the values are different between the mean and the median … LOOOOOOOK ! This is why when you have a skewed (unsymmetrical) distribution it’s usually more interesting to use the median as a measure of the central tendency of the data. One important thing to note here, for the two first attributes, the mean is higher than the median, but for the last it’s the opposite. This can tell you a thing or two about the shape of your distribution : if the mean is higher than the median, this means that the distribution is skewed to the right (right tail) which pulls the mean higher. And vice-versa.\nMoral of the story is … outliers are a pain in the a**.\n\n# Spread : Standard Deviation vs Inter-Quartile Range vs Median Absolute Deviation (MAD)\nstds = df_tuber[chosen_colnames].std()\niqrs = df_tuber[chosen_colnames].quantile(0.75) - df_tuber[chosen_colnames].quantile(0.25)\nmedianAD = mad(df_tuber[chosen_colnames])\n\noutput = pd.DataFrame(stds, columns = ['std']).T\noutput = pd.concat([output, pd.DataFrame(iqrs, columns = ['IQR']).T], ignore_index=False)\noutput = pd.concat([output, pd.DataFrame(medianAD, columns = ['MAD'], index = chosen_colnames).T], ignore_index=False, names = ['std', 'iqr', 'mad'])\noutput\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ne_pop_num\ne_prev_100k\nc_cdr\n\n\n\n\nstd\n1.177827e+08\n269.418159\n25.234773\n\n\nIQR\n1.677193e+07\n280.500000\n34.000000\n\n\nMAD\n7.454908e+06\n120.090780\n25.204238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values here are different as well, maybe more so for the “e_pop_num” attribute than the others, but that is just because of the scaling : “e_pop_num” takes big values overall compared to the other columns, which you can check with the mean values right above.\nFor the first attribute, the standard deviation is higher, and both the IQR and MAD are close to each other. For the second attribute, the inter-quartile range is slightly higher than the standard deviation, but the MAD is far below (less than half) the other two values, and the reason for that is a little bit involved : Basically, the standard deviation measures the spread by computing the squared deviation from the mean while the median absolute deviation evaluates the spread by computing the absolute deviation. This means that when the outliers have much bigger values than the “normal” points, the squared difference explodes (figuratively of course ;p) compared to the absolute difference. And this is actually the case for our second distribution (e_prev_100k) where most values are between 50 and 300 while many outliers lay above the 750 mark and go all the way up to 1800 (look at the boxplots below). For the third attribute the values are somewhat close, especially the std and the MAD, that’s because if you inspect the boxplot, this column doesn’t have many outliers to begin with.\nNonetheless, the differences are real, and if we don’t want to have to handle outliers, then we should be using robust statistics like the median to describe the central tendency and inter-quartile range or median absolute deviation to measure the spread of our data.\n\n# Boxplots of the different columns\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,20))\n\nplt.subplot(3,2,1)\nplt.hist(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[0]])\nplt.title('Histogram of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[0]))\nplt.subplot(3,2,2)\nplt.boxplot(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[0]])\nplt.title('Boxplot of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[0]))\n\nplt.subplot(3,2,3)\nplt.hist(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[1]])\nplt.title('Histogram of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[1]))\nplt.subplot(3,2,4)\nplt.boxplot(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[1]])\nplt.title('Boxplot of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[1]))\n\nplt.subplot(3,2,5)\nplt.hist(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[2]])\nplt.title('Histogram of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[2]))\nplt.subplot(3,2,6)\nplt.boxplot(df_tuber[chosen_colnames[2]])\nplt.title('Boxplot of \"{}\"'.format(chosen_colnames[2]));"

The general linear model: \\[ \\textbf{y}  =  a_0+ a_1 \\textbf{x}_1 \\]\nThe parameter \\(a_0\\) is called the constant term or the intercept.\nIn the case of multiple linear regression we extend this idea by fitting a m-dimensional hyperplane to our m predictors.\n\\[ \\textbf{y}  =  a_1 \\textbf{x}_1  + \\dots + a_m \\textbf{x}_{m} \\]\nThe \\(a_i\\) are termed the parameters of the model or the coefficients.\n\n\n12.1.2 Ordinary Least Squares\nOrdinary Least Squares (OLS) is the simplest and most common estimator in which the coefficients \\(a\\)’s of the simple linear regression: \\(\\textbf{y} = a_0+a_1 \\textbf{x}\\), are chosen to minimize the square of the distance between the predicted values and the actual values.\n\\[ ||a_0 + a_1 \\textbf{x} -  \\textbf{y} ||^2_2 = \\sum_{j=1}^n (a_0+a_1 x_{j} -  y_j )^2,\\]\nThis expression is often called sum of squared errors of prediction (SSE)."

Scikit-learn provides an object-oriented interface centered around the concept of an Estimator. The Estimator.fit method sets the state of the estimator based on the training data. Usually, the data is comprised of a two-dimensional numpy array \\(X\\) of shape (n_samples, n_predictors) that holds the so-called feature matrix and a one-dimensional numpy array \\(\\textbf{y}\\) that holds the responses. Some estimators allow the user to control the fitting behavior. For example, the sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression estimator allows the user to specify whether or not to fit an intercept term. This is done by setting the corresponding constructor arguments of the estimator object. During the fitting process, the state of the estimator is stored in instance attributes that have a trailing underscore (_). For example, the coefficients of a LinearRegression estimator are stored in the attribute coef_.\nEstimators that can generate predictions provide a Estimator.predict method. In the case of regression, Estimator.predict will return the predicted regression values, \\(\\hat{\\textbf{y}}\\).\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nest = LinearRegression(fit_intercept = True)\n\nx = ice2[['year']]\ny = ice2[['extent']]\n\nest.fit(x, y)\n\nprint(\"Coefficients:\", est.coef_)\nprint (\"Intercept:\", est.intercept_)\n\nCoefficients: [[-0.05018625]]\nIntercept: [111.95135764]\n\n\nWe can evaluate the model fitting by computing the mean squared error (\\(MSE\\)) and the coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)) of the model.

We look into how a number of techniques help us construct artificial spaces – projections – that provide the basis for further operations. We then look into the topic of cluster analysis and will discuss a number of techniques that can help us explore “structures” in low and high dimensional data sets. We will also explore how projection spaces and the notions of distance come into play."

And the second line of numbers correspond to the loadings of the variables within the “second” principal component.\nBut then, what do these numbers tell us? One analysis we can do here is to look at the “magnitude” of these numbers. If you look at the four numbers, we notice that the largest in magnitude is for Petal Length (0.85667061) which indicates that the most important dimension for this component is Petal Length. As far as PCA is concerned, the notion of importance is how much of the “variance” of the data is explained by a principal component, so Petal Length is the feature that has the most influence on the variation within the data along the first component. And the first component is the computed axis that explains most of the variance in the data (i.e., has the highest eigenvalue in the computations – see the slides). We can do a similar analysis for the second component, and notice that Sepal Widht is the most key variable in this component but I Sepal Length is also important as seen from its higher loading value.\nIf we look at these four variables, the only variable that didn’t get a high loading is Petal Width, this is a sign that this feature might not carry similar levels of variation as the others.\n\n15.2.1.1 How about the “projection”?\nWhat we look at above in the scatterplot, what we are seeing is all the observations “projected” onto this new space defined by the two principal components. This is why dimension reduction methods are often referred to as “projection” or “embedding” methods. The idea is that the new components give you a new “space” where you can observe your data points. This is what the X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X) line is doing in the code above."

For example, if the sepal widths were in meters and the other variables in cm then an algorithm may underweight sepal widths. This means that we will need to rescale our variables to be in the safe side. There are two ways to put variables into the same scale: normalisation and standarisation.\n\nNormalisation: rescales a dataset so that each value falls between 0 and 1. It uses the following formula to do so:\n\n\\[xnew = (xi – xmin) / (xmax – xmin)\\]\n\nStandarisation: rescales a dataset to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. It uses the following formula to do so:\n\n\\[xnew = (xi – x) / s\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich one should we use?\n\n\n\nIf you cannot choose between them then try it both ways.

We have seen several ways to do this, but in this case we will be using a new plot type (a violin plot) to visualise the distribution.\nTo do so, we will be using seaborn’s violinplot(). Because we want to create a single plot with a violin plot per variable, we will need to transform our data from wide to a long format.\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of Violin plot. (Chambers 2017)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWide vs long data\n\n\n\nA dataset can be written in two different formats: wide and long.\n\nwide: every row is a unique observation, where columns are variables (or attributes) describing the observation.\nlong: single observations are split into multiple rows. Usually, the first column contains the index to the observation, and there are two more columns: the name of the variable, and the actual value of the variable.\n\n\n\n\nWide vs long data (Source: Statology)\n\n\n\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# some plots require a long dataframe structure\niris_df_long = iris_df.melt()\niris_df_long\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvariable\nvalue\n\n\n\n\n0\nsepal length (cm)\n0.222222\n\n\n1\nsepal length (cm)\n0.166667\n\n\n2\nsepal length (cm)\n0.111111\n\n\n3\nsepal length (cm)\n0.083333\n\n\n4\nsepal length (cm)\n0.194444\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n595\npetal width (cm)\n0.916667\n\n\n596\npetal width (cm)\n0.750000\n\n\n597\npetal width (cm)\n0.791667\n\n\n598\npetal width (cm)\n0.916667\n\n\n599\npetal width (cm)\n0.708333\n\n\n\n\n600 rows × 2 columns\n\n\n\nAnd now that we have transformed our data into a long data format, we can create the visualisation:\n\nsns.violinplot(data = iris_df_long, x = 'variable', y = 'value')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='variable', ylabel='value'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n16.1.2.2 Correlations\nThe below plots use the wide data structure.\n\niris_df\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.222222\n0.625000\n0.067797\n0.041667\n\n\n1\n0.166667\n0.416667\n0.067797\n0.041667\n\n\n2\n0.111111\n0.500000\n0.050847\n0.041667\n\n\n3\n0.083333\n0.458333\n0.084746\n0.041667\n\n\n4\n0.194444\n0.666667\n0.067797\n0.041667\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n145\n0.666667\n0.416667\n0.711864\n0.916667\n\n\n146\n0.555556\n0.208333\n0.677966\n0.750000\n\n\n147\n0.611111\n0.416667\n0.711864\n0.791667\n\n\n148\n0.527778\n0.583333\n0.745763\n0.916667\n\n\n149\n0.444444\n0.416667\n0.694915\n0.708333\n\n\n\n\n150 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = iris_df, x = 'sepal length (cm)', y = 'sepal width (cm)')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='sepal length (cm)', ylabel='sepal width (cm)'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = iris_df, x = 'sepal length (cm)', y = 'petal length (cm)')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='sepal length (cm)', ylabel='petal length (cm)'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nInteresting.

    "text": "16.2 Clustering\nA cluster is simply a group based on simliarity. There are several methods and we will use a relatively simple one called K-means clustering.\nIn K-means clustering an algorithm tries to group our items (plants in the iris dataset) based on similarity. We decide how many groups we want and the algorithm does the best it can (an accessible introduction to k-means clustering is here).\nTo start, we import the KMeans function from sklearn cluster

    "text": "16.3 IMPORTANT: Check if your data features are standardised/normalised!!\nBefore you apply techniques such as PCA, clustering or other feature embedding technniques (such as t-SNE, MDS, etc.). It is very important to make sure that the data features that go into these techniques are normalised/standardised: - you can bring the value ranges between 0 and 1 for all of them with a MixMax scaling operation - https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html - you can standardise the values to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, aka, z-score standardisation – https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler.html - Or make use of more specific normalisation operators that might be more suitable for a particular context. The scikit-learn collection is a good place to look for alternatives – https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.preprocessing\nThese operations ensure that the results are not biased/skewed/dominated by some of the inherent characteristics of the data that is simply due to the domain of values.\nScikit-learn has some very nice tutorial here: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/preprocessing/plot_scaling_importance.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-preprocessing-plot-scaling-importance-py\n::: callout-caution"

The method derives point in an n dimentional space from our data which are uncorrelated.\nTo carry out a PCA on our Iris dataset where there are only two dimensions.\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\nn_components = 2\n\npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\niris_pca = pca.fit(iris_df.iloc[:,0:4])\n\nWe can look at the components.\n\niris_pca.components_\n\narray([[ 0.42494212, -0.15074824,  0.61626702,  0.64568888],\n       [ 0.42320271,  0.90396711, -0.06038308, -0.00983925]])\n\n\nThese components are intersting. You may want to look at a PennState article on interpreting PCA components.\nOur second column, ‘sepal width (cm)’ is positively correlated with our second principle component whereas the first column ‘sepal length (cm)’ is postively correlated with both.\nYou may want to consider:\n\nDo we need more than two components?\nIs it useful to keep sepal length (cm) in the dataset?\n\nWe can also examine the explained variance of the each principle component.\n\niris_pca.explained_variance_\n\narray([0.23245325, 0.0324682 ])\n\n\nA nice worked example showing the link between the explained variance and the component is here.\nOur first principle component explains a lot more of the variance of data then the second.\nAnother way to explore these indicators is to look at the explained_variance_ratio_ values. These present a similar information but provide them as percentage values so they are easier to interpret. You can also create a plot and see how these percentages add up. In this case, the first two components add up to 0.96. Which means the first two features are able to represent around 96% of the variation in the data, not bad. These values are not always this high.\nA high value that is close to 100% means that the PCA is able to represent much of the variance and they will be good representations of the data without losing a lot of that variance in the underlying features. This of course is based on an assumption that variance is a good proxy about how informative a feature is.\n\niris_pca.explained_variance_ratio_\n\narray([0.84136038, 0.11751808])\n\n\n\nplt.plot(np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))\nplt.xlabel('number of components')\nplt.ylabel('cumulative explained variance');\n\n\n\n\n\n16.5.1 Dimension reduction\nFor our purposes, we are interested in using PCA for reducing the number of dimension in our data whilst preseving the maximal data variance.\nWe can extract the projected components from the model.\n\niris_pca_vals = pca.fit_transform(iris_df.iloc[:,0:4])\n\nThe numpy arrays contains the projected values.\n\ntype(iris_pca_vals)\n\nnumpy.ndarray\n\n\n\niris_pca_vals\n\narray([[-6.30702931e-01,  1.07577910e-01],\n       [-6.22904943e-01, -1.04259833e-01],\n       [-6.69520395e-01,

We clearly want no more than three.\nThese types of plots show an point about model complexity. More free parameters in the model (here the number of clusters) will improve how well the model captures the data, often with reducing returns. However, a model which overfits the data will not be able to fit new data well - referred to overfitting. Randomish internet blogs introduce the topic pretty well, see here, and also wikipedia, see here.\n\n\n16.5.3 Missing values\nFinally, how we deal with missing values can impact the results of PCA and kMeans clustering.\nLets us load in the iris dataset again and randomly remove 10% of the data (see code from here).\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nx = load_iris()\n\n\niris_df = pd.DataFrame(x.data, columns = x.feature_names)\n\nmask = np.random.choice([True, False], size = iris_df.shape, p = [0.2, 0.8])\nmask[mask.all(1),-1] = 0\n\ndf = iris_df.mask(mask)\n\ndf.isna().sum()\n\nsepal length (cm)    23\nsepal width (cm)     28\npetal length (cm)    21\npetal width (cm)     31\ndtype: int64\n\n\n\ndf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\n\n\n1\nNaN\nNaN\nNaN\n0.2\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\nNaN\n0.2\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n145\n6.7\n3.0\nNaN\nNaN\n\n\n146\n6.3\n2.5\n5.0\n1.9\n\n\n147\n6.5\nNaN\nNaN\n2.0\n\n\n148\n6.2\n3.4\n5.4\n2.3\n\n\n149\nNaN\n3.0\n5.1\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n150 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\nAbout 20% of the data is randomly an NaN.\n\n16.5.3.1 Zeroing\nWe can 0 them and fit our models.\n\ndf_1 = df.copy()\ndf_1 = df_1.fillna(0)\n\n\ndf_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.1\n3.5\n1.4\n0.2\n\n\n1\n0.0\n0.0\n0.0\n0.2\n\n\n2\n4.7\n3.2\n1.3\n0.2\n\n\n3\n4.6\n3.1\n0.0\n0.2\n\n\n4\n5.0\n3.6\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n145\n6.7\n3.0\n0.0\n0.0\n\n\n146\n6.3\n2.5\n5.0\n1.9\n\n\n147\n6.5\n0.0\n0.0\n2.0\n\n\n148\n6.2\n3.4\n5.4\n2.3\n\n\n149\n0.0\n3.0\n5.1\n1.8\n\n\n\n\n150 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\nk_means_zero = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, init = 'random', n_init = 10)\nk_means_zero.fit(df_1)\ndf_1['Four clusters'] = pd.Series(k_means_zero.predict(df_1.iloc[:,0:4].values), index = df_1.index)\nsns.pairplot(df_1, hue = 'Four clusters')\n\n\n\n\nWhat impact has zeroing the values had on our results?\nNow, onto PCA.\n\n# PCA analysis\nn_components = 2\n\npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\ndf_1_pca = pca.fit(df_1.iloc[:,0:4])\n\n# Extract projected values\ndf_1_pca_vals = df_1_pca.transform(df_1.iloc[:,0:4])\ndf_1['c1'] = [item[0] for item in df_1_pca_vals]\ndf_1['c2'] = [item[1] for item in df_1_pca_vals]\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = df_1, x = 'c1', y = 'c2')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='c1', ylabel='c2'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_1_pca.explained_variance_\n\narray([5.3176492 , 4.20322317])\n\n\n\ndf_1_pca.components_\n\narray([[-0.84439271, -0.02201056, -0.52209728, -0.11802933],\n       [-0.53545858,  0.00318789,  0.82384805,  0.18587184]])\n\n\n\n\n16.5.3.2 Replacing with the average\n\ndf_2 = df.copy()\nfor i in range(4):\n    df_2.iloc[:,i] = df_2.iloc[:,i].fillna(df_2.iloc[:,i].mean())\n\n\ndf_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsepal length (cm)\nsepal width (cm)\npetal length (cm)\npetal width (cm)\n\n\n\n\n0\n5.100000\n3.500000\n1.400000\n0.200000\n\n\n1\n5.806299\n3.045902\n3.735659\n0.200000\n\n\n2\n4.700000\n3.200000\n1.300000\n0.200000\n\n\n3\n4.600000\n3.100000\n3.735659\n0.200000\n\n\n4\n5.000000\n3.600000\n3.735659\n1.178992\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n145\n6.700000\n3.000000\n3.735659\n1.178992\n\n\n146\n6.300000\n2.500000\n5.000000\n1.900000\n\n\n147\n6.500000\n3.045902\n3.735659\n2.000000\n\n\n148\n6.200000\n3.400000\n5.400000\n2.300000\n\n\n149\n5.806299\n3.000000\n5.100000\n1.800000\n\n\n\n\n150 rows × 4 columns\n\n\n\n\nk_means_zero = KMeans(n_clusters = 4, init = 'random', n_init = 10)\nk_means_zero.fit(df_2)\ndf_2['Four clusters'] = pd.Series(k_means_zero.predict(df_2.iloc[:,0:4].values), index = df_2.index)\nsns.pairplot(df_2, hue = 'Four clusters')\n\n\n\n\n\n# PCA analysis\nn_components = 2\n\npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\ndf_2_pca = pca.fit(df_2.iloc[:,0:4])\n\n# Extract projected values\ndf_2_pca_vals = df_2_pca.transform(df_2.iloc[:,0:4])\ndf_2['c1'] = [item[0] for item in df_2_pca_vals]\ndf_2['c2'] = [item[1] for item in df_2_pca_vals]\n\nsns.scatterplot(data = df_2, x = 'c1', y = 'c2')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='c1', ylabel='c2'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf_2_pca.explained_variance_\n\narray([3.31519797, 0.27508431])\n\n\n\ndf_2_pca.components_\n\narray([[ 0.3347291 , -0.07564839,  0.88336309,  0.31922313],\n       [ 0.86390194,  0.33976241, -0.34674533,  0.13417384]])"

What would be a good way to approach this?\nA few steps we always take: - Use the internal spreadsheet viewer in JupyterLab, go into the data folder and have a look at the data. - Check the size of the dataset. Do you remember how to look at the shape of a dataset? - Get a summary of the data, observe the descriptive statistics. - Check the data types and see if there are mixes of different types, such as numerical, categorical, textual, etc.. - Create a visualisation to get a first peek into the relations. Think about the number of features. Is a visualisation feasible?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo-this-yourself: Check if we need to do any normalisation for this case?\n\n\n\nWhat are the descriptive statistics look like, see if we need to do anything more?\nUsually a standardisation is recommended before you apply PCA on a dataset.

    "text": "17.2 Principal Component Analysis\nNote for the above: In case you wondered, we have done some cleaning and preprocessing on this data to make things easier for you, so normalisation might not be needed or at least won’t make a lot of difference to the results. But the real life will always be much more messier.\nOK, you probably have noticed that there is a lot of data features we have here. Let’s start experimenting with the PCA technique and see what it could surface. Maybe it will help us reduce the dimensionality a little but and tell us something about the features.\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\nn_components = 2\n \npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\ndf_pca = pca.fit(df.iloc[:, 1:])\n\n\ndf_pca.explained_variance_ratio_\n\narray([0.67387831, 0.08863102])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do these numbers mean?\n\n\n\n\ndf_pca_vals = pca.fit_transform(df.iloc[:,1:])\ndf['c1'] = [item[0] for item in df_pca_vals]\ndf['c2'] = [item[1] for item in df_pca_vals]\n\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.scatterplot(data = df, x = 'c1', y = 'c2')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='c1', ylabel='c2'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nHmm, that looks problematic. What is going on? When you see patterns like this, you will need to take a step back and look at everything closely.\nWe should look at the component loadings. Though there are going to be over 200 of them. We can put them into a Pandas dataframe and then sort them.\n\n\n\ndata = {'columns' : df.columns[1:102],\n        'component 1' : df_pca.components_[0],\n        'component 2' : df_pca.components_[1]}\n\n\nloadings = pd.DataFrame(data)\nloadings.sort_values(by=['component 1'], ascending=False, key=abs) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolumns\ncomponent 1\ncomponent 2\n\n\n\n\n0\nfold\n0.999788\n-0.016430\n\n\n12\npctUrban\n0.004944\n0.146079\n\n\n37\nPctOccupManu\n-0.004403\n-0.132659\n\n\n85\nRentHighQ\n0.004078\n0.188187\n\n\n13\nmedIncome\n0.003932\n0.185649\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n92\nPctForeignBorn\n0.000076\n0.024639\n\n\n3\nracepctblack\n0.000066\n-0.130905\n\n\n5\nracePctAsian\n0.000064\n0.061561\n\n\n99\nPctUsePubTrans\n0.000037\n0.036078\n\n\n6\nracePctHisp\n-0.000002\n-0.064135\n\n\n\n\n101 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\nloadings.sort_values(by=['component 2'], ascending=False) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncolumns\ncomponent 1\ncomponent 2\n\n\n\n\n85\nRentHighQ\n0.004078\n0.188187\n\n\n13\nmedIncome\n0.003932\n0.185649\n\n\n46\nPctYoungKids2Par\n0.003818\n0.178675\n\n\n20\nmedFamInc\n0.003025\n0.177225\n\n\n45\nPctKids2Par\n0.002385\n0.169581\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n51\nPctIlleg\n-0.001022\n-0.153504\n\n\n31\nPctNotHSGrad\n-0.002967\n-0.158646\n\n\n18\npctWPubAsst\n-0.003697\n-0.173593\n\n\n29\nPctPopUnderPov\n-0.003594\n-0.190548\n\n\n78\nPctHousNoPhone\n-0.001759\n-0.198116\n\n\n\n\n101 rows × 3 columns\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nDo you notice anything extraordinary within these variable loadings?\nRemember, the variable loadings tell us to what extent the information encoded along a principal component axis is determined by a single variable. In other words, how important a variable is. Haev a look and see if anything is too problematic here.\n\n\nThe fold variable is messing with our PCA. What does that variable look like.\n\ndf.fold.value_counts()\n\nfold\n1     200\n2     200\n3     200\n4     200\n5     199\n6     199\n7     199\n8     199\n9     199\n10    199\nName: count, dtype: int64\n\n\n\ndf['fold'].unique()\n\narray([ 1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10])\n\n\nAha!

These patterns allow us to answer questions.\nTo do this we:\n\nRead data into Python.\nLook at our data.\nWrangling our data. Often exploring raw data and dealing with missing values (imputation techniques), transformaing, normalising, standardising, outliers or reshaping.\nCarry out a series of analysis to better understand our data via clustering, regressions analysis, dimension reduction, and many other techniques.\nReflect on what the patterns in our data can tell us.\n\nThese are not mutually exclusive processes and are not exhaustive. One may review our data after cleaning, load in more data, carry out additional analysis and/or fit multiple models, tweak data summaries or adopt new techniques. Reflecting on the patterns are in our data can give way to additional analysis and processing."

Are the labels meaningful?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWe need to be really careful here. We notice that it is not easily possible to compare the known class labels to clustering labels. The reason is that the clustering algorithm labels are just arbitrary and not assigned to any deterministic criteria. Each time you run the algorithm, you might get a different id for the labels. The reason is that the label itself doesn’t actually mean anything, what is important is the list of items that are in the same cluster and their relations.\n\n\n\n22.3.1 Principal Components Analysis\nA way to come over this ambiguity and evaluate the results is to look at a visualisations of the results and compare. But this brings in the question of what type of visualisation to use for looking at the clusters. An immediate alternative is to use scatterplots. However, it is not clear which axis to use for clustering. A common method to apply at this stage is to make use of PCA to get a 2D plane where we can project the data points and visualise them over this projection.\n\n# We will be excluding the column `Class label` located in the first position from the PCA.\ndf.iloc[:,1:14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol\nMalic acid\nAsh\nAlcalinity of ash\nMagnesium\nTotal phenols\nFlavanoids\nNonflavanoid phenols\nProanthocyanins\nColor intensity\nHue\nOD280/OD315 of diluted wines\nProline\n\n\n\n\n0\n14.23\n1.71\n2.43\n15.6\n127\n2.80\n3.06\n0.28\n2.29\n5.64\n1.04\n3.92\n1065\n\n\n1\n13.20\n1.78\n2.14\n11.2\n100\n2.65\n2.76\n0.26\n1.28\n4.38\n1.05\n3.40\n1050\n\n\n2\n13.16\n2.36\n2.67\n18.6\n101\n2.80\n3.24\n0.30\n2.81\n5.68\n1.03\n3.17\n1185\n\n\n3\n14.37\n1.95\n2.50\n16.8\n113\n3.85\n3.49\n0.24\n2.18\n7.80\n0.86\n3.45\n1480\n\n\n4\n13.24\n2.59\n2.87\n21.0\n118\n2.80\n2.69\n0.39\n1.82\n4.32\n1.04\n2.93\n735\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n173\n13.71\n5.65\n2.45\n20.5\n95\n1.68\n0.61\n0.52\n1.06\n7.70\n0.64\n1.74\n740\n\n\n174\n13.40\n3.91\n2.48\n23.0\n102\n1.80\n0.75\n0.43\n1.41\n7.30\n0.70\n1.56\n750\n\n\n175\n13.27\n4.28\n2.26\n20.0\n120\n1.59\n0.69\n0.43\n1.35\n10.20\n0.59\n1.56\n835\n\n\n176\n13.17\n2.59\n2.37\n20.0\n120\n1.65\n0.68\n0.53\n1.46\n9.30\n0.60\n1.62\n840\n\n\n177\n14.13\n4.10\n2.74\n24.5\n96\n2.05\n0.76\n0.56\n1.35\n9.20\n0.61\n1.60\n560\n\n\n\n\n178 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\nAnd now, with the normalised dataset:\n\n# We will be excluding the column `Class label` located in the first position from the PCA.\ndf_norm.iloc[:,1:14]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcohol\nMalic acid\nAsh\nAlcalinity of ash\nMagnesium\nTotal phenols\nFlavanoids\nNonflavanoid phenols\nProanthocyanins\nColor intensity\nHue\nOD280/OD315 of diluted wines\nProline\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.842105\n0.191700\n0.572193\n0.257732\n0.619565\n0.627586\n0.573840\n0.283019\n0.593060\n0.372014\n0.455285\n0.970696\n0.561341\n\n\n1\n0.571053\n0.205534\n0.417112\n0.030928\n0.326087\n0.575862\n0.510549\n0.245283\n0.274448\n0.264505\n0.463415\n0.780220\n0.550642\n\n\n2\n0.560526\n0.320158\n0.700535\n0.412371\n0.336957\n0.627586\n0.611814\n0.320755\n0.757098\n0.375427\n0.447154\n0.695971\n0.646933\n\n\n3\n0.878947\n0.239130\n0.609626\n0.319588\n0.467391\n0.989655\n0.664557\n0.207547\n0.558360\n0.556314\n0.308943\n0.798535\n0.857347\n\n\n4\n0.581579\n0.365613\n0.807487\n0.536082\n0.521739\n0.627586\n0.495781\n0.490566\n0.444795\n0.259386\n0.455285\n0.608059\n0.325963\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n173\n0.705263\n0.970356\n0.582888\n0.510309\n0.271739\n0.241379\n0.056962\n0.735849\n0.205047\n0.547782\n0.130081\n0.172161\n0.329529\n\n\n174\n0.623684\n0.626482\n0.598930\n0.639175\n0.347826\n0.282759\n0.086498\n0.566038\n0.315457\n0.513652\n0.178862\n0.106227\n0.336662\n\n\n175\n0.589474\n0.699605\n0.481283\n0.484536\n0.543478\n0.210345\n0.073840\n0.566038\n0.296530\n0.761092\n0.089431\n0.106227\n0.397290\n\n\n176\n0.563158\n0.365613\n0.540107\n0.484536\n0.543478\n0.231034\n0.071730\n0.754717\n0.331230\n0.684300\n0.097561\n0.128205\n0.400856\n\n\n177\n0.815789\n0.664032\n0.737968\n0.716495\n0.282609\n0.368966\n0.088608\n0.811321\n0.296530\n0.675768\n0.105691\n0.120879\n0.201141\n\n\n\n\n178 rows × 13 columns\n\n\n\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\nn_components = 2\n\npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\ndf_pca = pca.fit(df.iloc[:,1:14])\ndf_pca_vals = df_pca.transform(df.iloc[:,1:14])\n\nAgain, we are repeating the same, but using the normalised dataframe:\n\n# We are repeating the same, with the normalised dataframe.\n\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\nn_components = 2\n\npca = PCA(n_components=n_components)\ndf_pca_norm = pca.fit(df_norm.iloc[:,1:14])\ndf_pca_norm_vals = df_pca_norm.transform(df_norm.iloc[:,1:14])\n\nGrab our projections and plot along with our cluster names.\n\n# Store components as a new column in the original dataframe.\ndf['c1'] = [item[0] for item in df_pca_vals]\ndf['c2'] = [item[1] for item in df_pca_vals]\n\nax = sns.scatterplot(data = df, x = 'c1', y = 'c2', hue = 'Class label')\nax.set_title('Known labels visualised over PCs (Original data)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Known labels visualised over PCs (Original data)')\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the same, with the normalised dataframe:\n\n# We are repeating the same, with the normalised dataframe.\n\n# Store components as a new column in the normalised dataframe.\ndf_norm['c1'] = [item[0] for item in df_pca_norm_vals]\ndf_norm['c2'] = [item[1] for item in df_pca_norm_vals]\n\nax = sns.scatterplot(data = df_norm, x = 'c1', y = 'c2', hue = 'Class label')\nax.set_title('Known labels visualised over PCs (Normalised data)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Known labels visualised over PCs (Normalised data)')\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the figure above, we colored the points based on the actual labels, we observe that there has been several misclassifications in the figure above (i.e., in the algorithm’s results).

What do you see?\n\n# Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model\nk_means = KMeans(n_clusters=3, init='random', n_init = 10)\n\n# Fit model to samples\ndf_k_means = k_means.fit(df.iloc[:,1:14])\n\ndf['Three clusters'] = pd.Series(df_k_means.predict(df.iloc[:,1:14].values), index = df.index)\n\nax = sns.scatterplot(data = df, x = 'c1', y = 'c2', hue = 'Three clusters')\nax.set_title('Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs (Original data)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs (Original data)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model\nk_means = KMeans(n_clusters=3, init='random', n_init = 10)\n\n# Fit model to samples\ndf_norm_k_means = k_means.fit(df_norm.iloc[:,1:14])\n\ndf_norm['Three clusters'] = pd.Series(df_norm_k_means.predict(df_norm.iloc[:,1:14].values), index = df.index)\n\nax = sns.scatterplot(data = df_norm, x = 'c1', y = 'c2', hue = 'Three clusters')\nax.set_title('Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs (Normalised data)')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs (Normalised data)')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n22.3.3 Removing some data\nHow about with only 80% of the data?\n\ndf_sample = df.sample(frac=0.8, replace=False)\n\n# Create a KMeans instance with k clusters: model\nk_means = KMeans(n_clusters=3, init='random', n_init = 10)\n\n# Fit model to samples\ndf_k_means = k_means.fit(df_sample.iloc[:,1:14])\n\ndf_sample['Three clusters'] = pd.Series(df_k_means.predict(df_sample.iloc[:,1:14].values), index = df_sample.index)\n\nax = sns.scatterplot(data = df_sample, x = 'c1', y = 'c2', hue = 'Three clusters')\nax.set_title('Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs')\n\nText(0.5, 1.0, 'Results of the algorithm visualised over PCs')\n\n\n\n\n\nWe may want to automate the process of resampling the data or rerunning the model then perhaps plotting the different inertia values or creating different plots.\nDo you think our clustering algorithm is stable and provide similiar results even when some data is removed or the initial values are random?\nIf so, then is our algorithm capturing the ground truth?\n\n\n\n\nCortez, Paulo, A Cerdeira, F Almeida, T Matos, and J.

    "text": "26.1 Clustering illusion\nThe cluster illusion refers to the natural tendency to wrongly see patterns or clusters in random data. You can find details of the clustering illusion here, here, and here.\n\n\n\n\n\n1,000 points randomly distributed inside a square, showing apparent clusters and empty spaces\n\n\nWe will try to replicate the image on the aside by generating a random dataset of 700 points with random x and y coordinates, and visualising them on a scatterplot to see if we can see any false clustering:\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pandas as pd\nimport altair as alt\n\n# Set number of observations in the dataframe that we are about to create.\nn = 700\n\n# Generate a random dataframe.\nd = {'x': np.random.uniform(0, 100, n), 'y': np.random.uniform(0, 100, n)}\ndf = pd.DataFrame(d)\n\n# Create a scatterplot with seaborn.\nsns.relplot(data = df, x = 'x', y = 'y')\n\n\n\n\nAnd now the same but using altair instead of seaborn. The syntax for building this type in Altair is pretty straight forward.\n\n# Basic scatterplot in Altair\nalt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=5).encode(\n    x='x',\n    y='y')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo remove those pesky lines we need to specify we want an x and y axis without grid lines.\n\nalt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=5).encode(\n    alt.X('x', axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)),\n    alt.Y('y', axis=alt.Axis(grid=False)))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\n\n\n\nDo you see any clustering the in the above plots? What about if we give names to the different columns?\n\n\nWe will do a lot of altering axis and colors in altair. We do this by specifying alt.axistype and then passing various options.\n\nalt.Chart(df).mark_circle(size=5).encode(\n    alt.X('x', axis=alt.Axis(grid=False, title='Height')),\n    alt.Y('y', axis=alt.Axis(grid=False, title='Weight')))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n26.1.1 Streaks\nAnother example of the clustering illusion is the idea of ‘streaks’, which consists of (wrongly) identifying a pattern from a small sample and extrapolate out.\n\n\n\nLet’s imagine you roll a dice. What are the odds of it being 6? And if we do a second roll? And a third? And if we repeat it 10 times?

Our spatial and poll data have the name of the state in common, but their columns have different names.\nWe could rename the columns names, and then join them with pd.merge() but instead, we are going to use a less destructive way.\nWe can join the geospatial data and poll data using pd.merge() while providing different column names by using left_on for the left data (usually the geodataframe) and right_on for the right dataframe. We will be using this method, as it doesn’t require to rename columns.\n\n# Add the poll data (divided in two data frames) to a single geospatial dataframe.\ngeo_states_trump = geo_states.merge(\n    trump_data, left_on = 'NAME', right_on = 'state')\n\ngeo_states_biden = geo_states.merge(\n    biden_data, left_on = 'NAME', right_on = 'state')\n\n\ngeo_states_trump.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEO_ID\nSTATE\nNAME\nLSAD\nCENSUSAREA\ngeometry\ncycle\nstate\nmodeldate\ncandidate_name\npct_estimate\npct_trend_adjusted\n\n\n\n\n0\n0400000US23\n23\nMaine\n\n30842.923\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-67.61976 44.51975, -67.61541 ...\n2020\nMaine\n11/3/2020\nDonald Trump\n40.34410\n40.31588\n\n\n1\n0400000US25\n25\nMassachusetts\n\n7800.058\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-70.83204 41.60650, -70.82373 ...\n2020\nMassachusetts\n11/3/2020\nDonald Trump\n28.56164\n28.86275\n\n\n2\n0400000US26\n26\nMichigan\n\n56538.901\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-88.68443 48.11579, -88.67563 ...\n2020\nMichigan\n11/3/2020\nDonald Trump\n43.20577\n43.23326\n\n\n3\n0400000US30\n30\nMontana\n\n145545.801\nPOLYGON ((-104.05770 44.99743, -104.25015 44.9...\n2020\nMontana\n11/3/2020\nDonald Trump\n49.74744\n49.78661\n\n\n4\n0400000US32\n32\nNevada\n\n109781.180\nPOLYGON ((-114.05060 37.00040, -114.04999 36.9...\n2020\nNevada\n11/3/2020\nDonald Trump\n44.32982\n44.36094\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeo_states_biden.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGEO_ID\nSTATE\nNAME\nLSAD\nCENSUSAREA\ngeometry\ncycle\nstate\nmodeldate\ncandidate_name\npct_estimate\npct_trend_adjusted\n\n\n\n\n0\n0400000US23\n23\nMaine\n\n30842.923\nMULTIPOLYGON (((-67.61976 44.51975, -67.61541 ...\n2020\nMaine\n11/3/2020\nJoseph R.

    "text": "31 5 In-depth Analysis - Outliers\nLet’s try to go a bit more in-depth . We know that gender doesn’t show many differences. In age there are not big differences except for one case. Let’s focus on ethnicity then.\nWe are going to use Seaborn’s ‘catplot’. In the documentation we can read what are the error bars here: “In seaborn, the barplot() function operates on a full dataset and applies a function to obtain the estimate (taking the mean by default). When there are multiple observations in each category, it also uses bootstrapping to compute a confidence interval around the estimate, which is plotted using error bars.”\nsns.catplot(x=\"Ethnicity\", y='Expenditures', \n            kind=\"bar\", data=df)\n\n#you can also run a nested table, but the chart might be more straightforward in analysis.\n#np.round(df.pivot_table(index=['cat_AgeCohort','Ethnicity'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\nnp.round(df.pivot_table(index=['Ethnicity'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\n\n\nEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian\n36438.25\n\n\nAsian\n18392.37\n\n\nBlack\n20884.59\n\n\nHispanic\n11065.57\n\n\nMulti Race\n4456.73\n\n\nNative Hawaiian\n42782.33\n\n\nOther\n3316.50\n\n\nWhite not Hispanic\n24697.55\nSo there are big differences in the averages between ethnicities.

There are 3 major ethnicities within the dataset: White non-Hispanic (40%), Hispanic (38%), Asian (13%). The sample sizes of other ethnicites are very small.\nPlease also remember that 1). We know it is representative data of the population of residents. So based on this data we can use inferential statistics (look up Week 03 slides if you need a reminder) and estimate results for the whole population of beneficiaries of California DDS.\n2). Also, if you look into actual demographics of California State here\nYou will notce that the proportions of the state are similar to proportions of this case study. Hispanic and White non-Hispanic constitute a majority of California’s population.\nLet’s focus on the top 2 biggest groups. We can see there is a difference in the average expenditures between the White non-Hispanic and Hispanic groups.\n##selecting cases that are either 'Hispanic' or 'White non Hispanic' \nHispanic = df[(df[\"Ethnicity\"] == 'Hispanic') | (df[\"Ethnicity\"] == 'White not Hispanic')]\nHispanic\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nId\nAgeCohort\nAge\nGender\nExpenditures\nEthnicity\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n0\n10210\n13-17\n17\nFemale\n2113\nWhite not Hispanic\n13-17\n\n\n1\n10409\n22-50\n37\nMale\n41924\nWhite not Hispanic\n22-50\n\n\n2\n10486\n0-5\n3\nMale\n1454\nHispanic\nNaN\n\n\n3\n10538\n18-21\n19\nFemale\n6400\nHispanic\n18-21\n\n\n4\n10568\n13-17\n13\nMale\n4412\nWhite not Hispanic\n13-17\n\n\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n992\n99114\n18-21\n18\nMale\n5298\nHispanic\n18-21\n\n\n995\n99622\n51 +\n86\nFemale\n57055\nWhite not Hispanic\nNaN\n\n\n996\n99715\n18-21\n20\nMale\n7494\nHispanic\n18-21\n\n\n998\n99791\n6-12\n10\nMale\n3638\nHispanic\n6-12\n\n\n999\n99898\n22-50\n23\nMale\n26702\nWhite not Hispanic\n22-50\n\n\n\n\n777 rows × 7 columns\nnp.round(Hispanic.pivot_table(index=['Ethnicity', 'cat_AgeCohort'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\n\n\nEthnicity\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\nHispanic\n6-12\n2312.19\n\n\n13-17\n3955.28\n\n\n18-21\n9959.85\n\n\n22-50\n40924.12\n\n\nWhite not Hispanic\n6-12\n2052.26\n\n\n13-17\n3904.36\n\n\n18-21\n10133.06\n\n\n22-50\n40187.62\nsns.catplot(x=\"cat_AgeCohort\", y='Expenditures', hue=\"Ethnicity\", kind=\"bar\", data=Hispanic)\nLet’s get back to our original question : does discrimination exist in this case?\n“Is the typical Hispanic consumer receiving fewer funds (i.e., expenditures) than the typical White non-Hispanic consumer? If a Hispanic consumer was to file for discrimination based upon ethnicity, s/he would more than likely be asked his/her age. Since the typical amount of expenditures for Hispanics (in all but one age cohort) is higher than the typical amount of expenditures for White non-Hispanics in the respective age cohort, the discrimination claim would be refuted”.\nThis case study shows Simpson’s Paradox. You may ask: “Why is the overall average for all consumers significantly different indicating ethnic discrimination of Hispanics, yet in all but one age cohort (18-21) the average of expenditures for Hispanic consumers are greater than those of the White non-Hispanic population?” Look at the table below.\npd.crosstab([Hispanic.cat_AgeCohort],Hispanic.Ethnicity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nHispanic\nWhite not Hispanic\n\n\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-12\n91\n46\n\n\n13-17\n103\n67\n\n\n18-21\n78\n69\n\n\n22-50\n43\n133\nResults\n“There are more Hispanics in the youngest four age cohorts, while the White non-Hispanics have more consumers in the oldest two age cohorts. The two populations are close in overall counts (376 vs. 401). On top of this, consumers expenditures increase as they age to see the paradox.\nExpenditure average for Hispanic consumers are higher in all but one of the age cohorts, but the trend reverses when the groups are combined resulting in a lower expenditure average for all Hispanic consumers when compared to all White non-Hispanics.”\n“The overall Hispanic consumer population is a relatively younger when compared to the White non-Hispanic consumer population. Since the expenditures for younger consumers is lower, the overall average of expenditures for Hispanics (vs White non-Hispanics) is less.”\npd.crosstab(Hispanic.cat_AgeCohort,Hispanic.Ethnicity, \n            normalize='columns')\n\n# values=Hispanic.Ethnicity,aggfunc=sum,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nHispanic\nWhite not Hispanic\n\n\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-12\n0.288889\n0.146032\n\n\n13-17\n0.326984\n0.212698\n\n\n18-21\n0.247619\n0.219048\n\n\n22-50\n0.136508\n0.422222"

The dataset represents a sample of 1,000 of these consumers. Biographical characteristics and expenditure data (i.e., the dollar amount the State spends on each consumer in supporting these individuals and their families) are included in the data set for each consumer.\n\n30.1.1 Source:\nThe data set originates from DDS’s “Client Master File.” In order to remain in compliance with California State Legislation, the data have been altered to protect the rights and privacy of specific individual consumers. The data set is designed to represent a sample of 1,000 DDS consumers.\n\n\n30.1.2 Variable Descriptions:\nA header line contains the name of the variables. There are no missing values.\nId: 5-digit, unique identification code for each consumer (similar to a social security number)\nAge Cohort: Binned age variable represented as six age cohorts (0-5, 6-12, 13-17, 18-21, 22-50, and 51+)\nAge: Unbinned age variable\nGender: Male or Female\nExpenditures: Dollar amount of annual expenditures spent on each consumer\nEthnicity: Eight ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Multi-race, Native Hawaiian, Other, and White non-Hispanic).\n\n\n30.1.3 Research problem\nThe data set and case study are based on a real-life scenario where there was a claim of discrimination based on ethnicity. The exercise highlights the importance of performing rigorous statistical analysis and how data interpretations can accurately inform or misguide decision makers.” (Taylor, Mickel 2014)"

This gives you also a hint they are different types of variables. The ‘bit’ refers to how long and precise the number is. Pandas uses data types from numpy (pandas documentation, numpy documentation). In our dataset three variables are numeric: Id, age are ordinal variables, Expenditures is a scale variable. AgeCohort is categorical and Gender and Ethnicity are nominal.\nFor that reason ‘data.describe’ will bring us a summary of numeric variables only.\n\ndf.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nId\nAge\nExpenditures\n\n\n\n\ncount\n1000.000000\n1000.000000\n1000.000000\n\n\nmean\n54662.846000\n22.800000\n18065.786000\n\n\nstd\n25643.673401\n18.462038\n19542.830884\n\n\nmin\n10210.000000\n0.000000\n222.000000\n\n\n25%\n31808.750000\n12.000000\n2898.750000\n\n\n50%\n55384.500000\n18.000000\n7026.000000\n\n\n75%\n76134.750000\n26.000000\n37712.750000\n\n\nmax\n99898.000000\n95.000000\n75098.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to plot not numeric variables or ids. That’s why we are going to just plot age and expenditures.\n\ndf.plot(x = 'Age', y = 'Expenditures', kind='scatter')\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='Age', ylabel='Expenditures'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pattern of data is very interesting, expecially around x-values of ca. 25. The research paper can bring us more clarification.\n\n\n30.3.3 Age\nThe crucial factor in this case study is age: “As consumers get older, their financial needs increase as they move out of their parent’s home, etc. Therefore, it is expected that expenditures for older consumers will be higher than for the younger consumers”\nIn the dataset we have two age variables that both refer to the same information - age of consumers. They are saved as two distinct data types: binned ‘AgeCohort’ and unbinned ‘Age’.\nAge categories If you look at the binned one you will notice that the categories are somewhat interesting:\n\ndf[['Age']].plot(kind='hist', ec='black')\n\n&lt;Axes: ylabel='Frequency'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[\"AgeCohort\"].describe() #we will receive the output for the categorical variable \"AgeCohort\"\ndf['cat_AgeCohort'].describe()\n\ncount       812\nunique        4\ntop       22-50\nfreq        226\nName: cat_AgeCohort, dtype: object\n\n\nHere we will run a bar plot of age categories.\n\ndf['cat_AgeCohort'].value_counts().plot(kind=\"bar\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='cat_AgeCohort'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default order of plot elements is ‘value count’. For the age variable it might be more useful to look at the order chronologically.\n\n#using sns.countplot from seaborn we will plot AgeCohort\n#the order in plotting this variable is really crucial, we want to have sorted by age categories\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n#here is without sorting / ordering\n#sns.countplot(x=\"AgeCohort\", data=df)\n\n#here we plot the variable with sorting\nsns.countplot(x=\"cat_AgeCohort\", data=df)\n\n#You can try playing with the commands below too:\n#sns.countplot(x=\"AgeCohort\", data=df, order=df['AgeCohort'].value_counts().index)\n#sns.countplot(x=\"AgeCohort\", data=df, order=['0-5', '6-12', '13-17', '18-21', '22-50','51+'])\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='cat_AgeCohort', ylabel='count'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy would the data be binned in such “uneven” categories like ‘0-5 years’, ‘6-12’ and ‘22-50’? Instead of even categories e.g. ‘0-10’, ‘11-20’, ‘21-30’ etc. or every 5 years ‘0-5’, ‘6-10’ etc.?\nHere the age cohorts were allocated based on the theory, rather than based on data (this way we would have even number of people in each category) or based on logical age categories, e.g. every 5 or 10 years.\nThe authors explain: “The cohorts are established based on the amount of financial support typically required during a particular life phase (…) The 0-5 cohort (preschool age) has the fewest needs and requires the least amount of funding (…) Those in the 51+ cohort have the most needs and require the most amount of funding”. You can read in more details in the paper."

    "text": "30.4 4 Exploratory analysis\nThe research question is: are any demographics discriminated in distributions of the funds?\nFollowing the authors: “Discrimination exists in this case study if the amount of expenditures for a typical person in a group of consumers that share a common attribute (e.g., gender, ethnicity, etc.) is significantly different when compared to a typical person in another group. For example, discrimination based on gender would occur if the expenditures for a typical female are less than the amount for a typical male.”\nWe are going to examine the data using plots for categorical data and pivot tables (cross-tables) with means. “Pivot table reports are particularly useful in narrowing down larger data sets or analyzing relationships between data points.” Pivot tables will help you understand what is Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n30.4.1 Age x expenditures\nLet’s see how expenditures are distributed across age groups.\nWe are going to use a swarm plot which I believe works well here to notice the paradox and “the points are adjusted (only along the categorical axis) so that they don’t overlap. This gives a better representation of the distribution of values, but it does not scale well to large numbers of observations. A swarm plot can be drawn on its own, but it is also a good complement to a box or violin plot in cases where you want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution.” Read more here\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsns.catplot(x=\"AgeCohort\", y=\"Expenditures\", kind=\"swarm\", data=df)\n#you can also do a boxplot if you change kind=\"box\"\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 83.5% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 35.4% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 76.8% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 58.8% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 14.2% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 84.0% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 85.8% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 42.5% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 80.5% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 64.8% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 21.7% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/categorical.py:3370: UserWarning: 86.9% of the points cannot be placed; you may want to decrease the size of the markers or use stripplot.\n  warnings.warn(msg, UserWarning)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.4.2 Ethnicity\nEthnicity could be another discriminating factor.

Let’s check means to see how it looks like by age, ethnicity and gender. Why would it be also good to check medians here?\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n#By default the aggreggate function is mean\n\nnp.round(df.pivot_table(index=['Ethnicity'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\n\n\nEthnicity\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Indian\n36438.25\n\n\nAsian\n18392.37\n\n\nBlack\n20884.59\n\n\nHispanic\n11065.57\n\n\nMulti Race\n4456.73\n\n\nNative Hawaiian\n42782.33\n\n\nOther\n3316.50\n\n\nWhite not Hispanic\n24697.55\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.round(df.pivot_table(index=['Gender'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\n\n\nGender\n\n\n\n\n\nFemale\n18129.61\n\n\nMale\n18001.20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnp.round(df.pivot_table(index=['cat_AgeCohort'], values=['Expenditures']), 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpenditures\n\n\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\n6-12\n2226.86\n\n\n13-17\n3922.61\n\n\n18-21\n9888.54\n\n\n22-50\n40209.28\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do these tables tell us? There is much discrepnacy in average results for ethnicity and age cohort. If we look at gender - there aren’t many differences.\nPlease remember that in this case study “the needs for consumers increase as they become older which results in higher expenditures”. This would explain age discrepancies a bit, but what about ethnicity?"

    "text": "32.1 Explanation\n“This exercise is based on a real-life case in California. The situation involved an alleged case of discrimination privileging White non-Hispanics over Hispanics in the allocation of funds to over 250,000 developmentally-disabled California residents.\nA number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third (⅓) of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. (…) A bivariate analysis examining ethnicity and age (divided into six age cohorts) revealed that ethnic discrimination did not exist. Moreover, in all but one of the age cohorts, the trend reversed where the average annual expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers were less than the expenditures on Hispanic consumers.”(Taylor, Mickel 2014)\nWhen running the simple table with aggregated data, the discrimination in this case appared evident. After running a few more detailed tables, it appears to be no evidence of discrimination based on this sample and the variables collected."

First results might give us a confusing result. Critical thinking is essential when working with data, in order to account for reasons not evident at the first sight. The authors remind us the following: 1) “outcome of important decisions (such as discrimination claims) are often heavily influenced by statistics and how an incomplete analysis may lead to poor decision making” 2) “importance of identifying and analyzing all sources of specific variation (i.e., potential influential factors) in statistical analyses”. This is something we already discussed in previous weeks, but it is never enough to stress it out”\n\n32.2.1 *Additional Links\nSome links regarding categorical data in Python for those interested:\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html#description\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.bar.html\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html"

    "text": "34.2 Explanations\n^ Gender pay gap defined as the difference between men’s and women’s hourly earnings as a percentage of men’s earnings.\n^^ Employees on adult rates whose pay for the survey pay-period was not affected by absence. Estimates for 2020 include employees who have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS).\nSource: Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, Office for National Statistics.\nTable 2.12 Gender pay gap (%)^ - For all employee jobs^^: United Kingdom, 2020\n\n34.2.1 Definitions\n• Gender pay gap (GPG) - calculated as the difference between average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men and women as a proportion of average hourly earnings (excluding overtime) of men. For example, a 4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% less, on average, than men. Conversely, a -4% GPG denotes that women earn 4% more, on average, than men.\n• Mean - a measure of the average which is derived by summing the values for a given sample, and then dividing the sum by the number of observations (i.e. jobs) in the sample. In earnings distributions, the mean can be disproportionately influenced by a relatively small number of high-paying jobs.\n• Median - the value below which 50% of jobs fall. It is ONS’s preferred measure of average earnings as it is less affected by a relatively small number of very high earners and the skewed distribution of earnings. It therefore gives a better indication of typical pay than the mean.\n• Full-time - employees working more than 30 paid hours per week (or 25 or more for the teaching professions).\n\n\n34.2.2 Coverage and timeliness\nASHE covers employee jobs in the United Kingdom. It does not cover the self-employed, nor does it cover employees not paid during the reference period.\nGPG estimates are provided for the pay period that included a specified date in April. They relate to employees on adult rates of pay, whose earnings for the survey pay period were not affected by absence. Estimates for 2020 include employees who have been furloughed under the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (CJRS).\nASHE is based on a 1% sample of jobs taken from HM Revenue and Customs’ Pay As You Earn (PAYE) records. Consequently, individuals with more than one job may appear in the sample more than once.\n#### Quality measures\nThe colour coding within the tables indicates the quality of each estimate and is based upon the coefficient of variation (CV) values for the corresponding male and female earnings estimates. The CV is the ratio of the standard error of an estimate to the estimate itself and is expressed as a percentage. The smaller the CV the greater the accuracy of the estimate. The colour coding for the GPG estimates is derived as follows:\n• If the CV values of both the male and female earnings estimates are less than or equal to 5% then the GPG estimate is considered good quality.\n• If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 5% and less than or equal to 10% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 10%) then the GPG estimate is considered reasonable quality.\n• If the CV value of either (or both) the male or female earnings estimate is greater than 10% and less than or equal to 20% (and the CV of the other estimate is less than or equal to 20%) then the GPG estimate is considered lower quality and should be used with caution.\n• If the CV value of at least one of the earnings estimates is greater than 20% then the GPG estimate is considered unreliable for practical purposes and is suppressed."

We know it is representative data of the population of residents.

If a Hispanic consumer was to file for discrimination based upon ethnicity, s/he would more than likely be asked his/her age. Since the typical amount of expenditures for Hispanics (in all but one age cohort) is higher than the typical amount of expenditures for White non-Hispanics in the respective age cohort, the discrimination claim would be refuted”.\nThis case study shows Simpson’s Paradox. You may ask: “Why is the overall average for all consumers significantly different indicating ethnic discrimination of Hispanics, yet in all but one age cohort (18-21) the average of expenditures for Hispanic consumers are greater than those of the White non-Hispanic population?” Look at the table below.\npd.crosstab([Hispanic.cat_AgeCohort],Hispanic.Ethnicity)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nHispanic\nWhite not Hispanic\n\n\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-12\n91\n46\n\n\n13-17\n103\n67\n\n\n18-21\n78\n69\n\n\n22-50\n43\n133\nResults\n“There are more Hispanics in the youngest four age cohorts, while the White non-Hispanics have more consumers in the oldest two age cohorts. The two populations are close in overall counts (376 vs. 401). On top of this, consumers expenditures increase as they age to see the paradox.\nExpenditure average for Hispanic consumers are higher in all but one of the age cohorts, but the trend reverses when the groups are combined resulting in a lower expenditure average for all Hispanic consumers when compared to all White non-Hispanics.”\n“The overall Hispanic consumer population is a relatively younger when compared to the White non-Hispanic consumer population. Since the expenditures for younger consumers is lower, the overall average of expenditures for Hispanics (vs White non-Hispanics) is less.”\npd.crosstab(Hispanic.cat_AgeCohort,Hispanic.Ethnicity, \n            normalize='columns')\n\n# values=Hispanic.Ethnicity,aggfunc=sum,\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEthnicity\nHispanic\nWhite not Hispanic\n\n\ncat_AgeCohort\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6-12\n0.288889\n0.146032\n\n\n13-17\n0.326984\n0.212698\n\n\n18-21\n0.247619\n0.219048\n\n\n22-50\n0.136508\n0.422222"

The dataset represents a sample of 1,000 of these consumers. Biographical characteristics and expenditure data (i.e., the dollar amount the State spends on each consumer in supporting these individuals and their families) are included in the data set for each consumer.\n\n35.1.1 Source:\nThe data set originates from DDS’s “Client Master File.” In order to remain in compliance with California State Legislation, the data have been altered to protect the rights and privacy of specific individual consumers. The data set is designed to represent a sample of 1,000 DDS consumers.\n\n\n35.1.2 Variable Descriptions:\nA header line contains the name of the variables. There are no missing values.\nId: 5-digit, unique identification code for each consumer (similar to a social security number)\nAge Cohort: Binned age variable represented as six age cohorts (0-5, 6-12, 13-17, 18-21, 22-50, and 51+)\nAge: Unbinned age variable\nGender: Male or Female\nExpenditures: Dollar amount of annual expenditures spent on each consumer\nEthnicity: Eight ethnic groups (American Indian, Asian, Black, Hispanic, Multi-race, Native Hawaiian, Other, and White non-Hispanic).\n\n\n35.1.3 Research problem\nThe data set and case study are based on a real-life scenario where there was a claim of discrimination based on ethnicity. The exercise highlights the importance of performing rigorous statistical analysis and how data interpretations can accurately inform or misguide decision makers.” (Taylor, Mickel 2014)"

This gives you also a hint they are different types of variables. The ‘bit’ refers to how long and precise the number is. Pandas uses data types from numpy (pandas documentation, numpy documentation). In our dataset three variables are numeric: Id, age are ordinal variables, Expenditures is a scale variable. AgeCohort is categorical and Gender and Ethnicity are nominal.\nFor that reason ‘data.describe’ will bring us a summary of numeric variables only.\n\ndf.describe()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nId\nAge\nExpenditures\n\n\n\n\ncount\n1000.000000\n1000.000000\n1000.000000\n\n\nmean\n54662.846000\n22.800000\n18065.786000\n\n\nstd\n25643.673401\n18.462038\n19542.830884\n\n\nmin\n10210.000000\n0.000000\n222.000000\n\n\n25%\n31808.750000\n12.000000\n2898.750000\n\n\n50%\n55384.500000\n18.000000\n7026.000000\n\n\n75%\n76134.750000\n26.000000\n37712.750000\n\n\nmax\n99898.000000\n95.000000\n75098.000000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to plot not numeric variables or ids.

The research paper can bring us more clarification.\n\n\n35.3.3 Age\nThe crucial factor in this case study is age: “As consumers get older, their financial needs increase as they move out of their parent’s home, etc. Therefore, it is expected that expenditures for older consumers will be higher than for the younger consumers”\nIn the dataset we have two age variables that both refer to the same information - age of consumers. They are saved as two distinct data types: binned ‘AgeCohort’ and unbinned ‘Age’.\nAge categories If you look at the binned one you will notice that the categories are somewhat interesting:\n\ndf[['Age']].plot(kind='hist', ec='black')\n\n&lt;Axes: ylabel='Frequency'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndf[\"AgeCohort\"].describe() #we will receive the output for the categorical variable \"AgeCohort\"\ndf['cat_AgeCohort'].describe()\n\ncount       812\nunique        4\ntop       22-50\nfreq        226\nName: cat_AgeCohort, dtype: object\n\n\nHere we will run a bar plot of age categories.\n\ndf['cat_AgeCohort'].value_counts().plot(kind=\"bar\")\n\n&lt;Axes: xlabel='cat_AgeCohort'&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default order of plot elements is ‘value count’.

Instead of even categories e.g. ‘0-10’, ‘11-20’, ‘21-30’ etc. or every 5 years ‘0-5’, ‘6-10’ etc.?\nHere the age cohorts were allocated based on the theory, rather than based on data (this way we would have even number of people in each category) or based on logical age categories, e.g. every 5 or 10 years.\nThe authors explain: “The cohorts are established based on the amount of financial support typically required during a particular life phase (…) The 0-5 cohort (preschool age) has the fewest needs and requires the least amount of funding (…) Those in the 51+ cohort have the most needs and require the most amount of funding”.

    "text": "35.4 4 Exploratory analysis\nThe research question is: are any demographics discriminated in distributions of the funds?\nFollowing the authors: “Discrimination exists in this case study if the amount of expenditures for a typical person in a group of consumers that share a common attribute (e.g., gender, ethnicity, etc.) is significantly different when compared to a typical person in another group. For example, discrimination based on gender would occur if the expenditures for a typical female are less than the amount for a typical male.”\nWe are going to examine the data using plots for categorical data and pivot tables (cross-tables) with means. “Pivot table reports are particularly useful in narrowing down larger data sets or analyzing relationships between data points.” Pivot tables will help you understand what is Simpson’s Paradox.\n\n35.4.1 Age x expenditures\nLet’s see how expenditures are distributed across age groups.\nWe are going to use a swarm plot which I believe works well here to notice the paradox and “the points are adjusted (only along the categorical axis) so that they don’t overlap. This gives a better representation of the distribution of values, but it does not scale well to large numbers of observations. A swarm plot can be drawn on its own, but it is also a good complement to a box or violin plot in cases where you want to show all observations along with some representation of the underlying distribution.” Read more here\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nsns.catplot(x=\"AgeCohort\", y=\"Expenditures\", kind=\"swarm\", data=df)\n#you can also do a boxplot if you change kind=\"box\"\n\n/Users/u2071219/anaconda3/envs/IM939/lib/python3.11/site-packages/seaborn/_oldcore.py:1498: FutureWarning: is_categorical_dtype is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

There is much discrepnacy in average results for ethnicity and age cohort. If we look at gender - there aren’t many differences.\nPlease remember that in this case study “the needs for consumers increase as they become older which results in higher expenditures”. This would explain age discrepancies a bit, but what about ethnicity?"

    "text": "37.1 Explanation\n“This exercise is based on a real-life case in California. The situation involved an alleged case of discrimination privileging White non-Hispanics over Hispanics in the allocation of funds to over 250,000 developmentally-disabled California residents.\nA number of years ago, an allegation of discrimination was made and supported by a univariate analysis that examined average annual expenditures on consumers by ethnicity. The analysis revealed that the average annual expenditures on Hispanic consumers was approximately one-third (⅓) of the average expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers. (…) A bivariate analysis examining ethnicity and age (divided into six age cohorts) revealed that ethnic discrimination did not exist. Moreover, in all but one of the age cohorts, the trend reversed where the average annual expenditures on White non-Hispanic consumers were less than the expenditures on Hispanic consumers.”(Taylor, Mickel 2014)\nWhen running the simple table with aggregated data, the discrimination in this case appared evident. After running a few more detailed tables, it appears to be no evidence of discrimination based on this sample and the variables collected."

First results might give us a confusing result. Critical thinking is essential when working with data, in order to account for reasons not evident at the first sight. The authors remind us the following: 1) “outcome of important decisions (such as discrimination claims) are often heavily influenced by statistics and how an incomplete analysis may lead to poor decision making” 2) “importance of identifying and analyzing all sources of specific variation (i.e., potential influential factors) in statistical analyses”. This is something we already discussed in previous weeks, but it is never enough to stress it out”\n\n37.2.1 *Additional Links\nSome links regarding categorical data in Python for those interested:\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/categorical.html#description\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.bar.html\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/tutorial/categorical.html\nhttps://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.countplot.html"

Each file starts with a meta-data section where the indicator is described so these brief information should be sufficient to understand the contents of the file. However, if you want to get a deeper understanding of the indicators and read about how they have been collected, you can have a look at this detailed page about the indicators.

We also provided you a Jupyter Notebook template on Moodle so that you can both present your ideas and if you have done already, present your initial steps on the coding side. You can find the JupyterNotebook template on Moodle on this link.\n\n\n38.1.2 Hands-on work on your own dataset(s)\nUse the rest of the session to start working on the datasets you identified to be relevant/interesting for your assessment. If you haven’t decided yet, this will also be a good occasion to “get your hands dirty” with the potential datasets, see if they can prove to be useful in what you plan to do. Staff will be “around” to give you feedback on any early issues you are facing and discuss your data plans.\nAs a team, you can have an open discussion on your project ideas, your datasets, and get feedback and guidance from your peers. Alternatively, you can choose your group to be a “silent” working group where you work silently on your own unless you want to discuss with others – looks like some people are finding it helpful (see an article on The Guardian on silent Zoom groups)."

Image below shows how the same command (import altar as alt) yields an error on Figure A.6 (a) because the environment has not been activated, whereas Figure A.6 (b) shows that the same code just works after activating the environment using the command conda activate IM939.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Error caused by not loading the environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) IM939 activated does not trigger any error\n\n\n\n\nFigure A.6: Running the same command yields different results depending on whether the environment has not been activated (A) or it has been activated (B).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nDid you notice that the terminal on Figure A.6 (a) shows (base) next to the command prompt, whereas Figure A.6 (b) shows (IM939) instead after having activated the environment?\nYou’ve guessed right: this is how the terminal will tell us which is our current environment."
